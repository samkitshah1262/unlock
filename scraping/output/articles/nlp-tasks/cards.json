The key aspect of open-domain QA is its versatility and breadth in handling questions from various fields, be it science, history, popular culture, etc.\n    \n\n**Open-Book QA**: Open-book question answering involves the use of external information sources to answer questions. In this approach, the system actively retrieves information from external documents, databases, or the internet to respond to queries. The focus is on the system’s ability to look up and synthesize information from outside its pre-trained knowledge base.\n\n**Open-Domain QA**: Open-domain question answering, on the other hand, refers to the system’s ability to answer questions across a wide range of topics or domains, without being restricted to a specific subject area. This can be achieved either through closed-book methods (where the model relies on its internal knowledge acquired during training) or open-book methods (where it looks up information externally). The key aspect of open-domain QA is its versatility and breadth in handling questions from various fields, be it science, history, popular culture, etc.\n\nIn summary, open-book QA is about the source of the information (external resources), while open-domain QA is about the scope of the topics (broad and unrestricted). A question answering system can be both open-book and open-domain if it uses external resources to answer questions on a wide range of topics.",

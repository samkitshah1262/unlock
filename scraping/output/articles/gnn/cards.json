    "contentHtml": "<ul>\n  <li>Originally proposed in <a href=\"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Gong_Exploiting_Edge_Features_for_Graph_Neural_Networks_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf\">Exploiting Edge Features for Graph Neural Networks</a> by Gong and Cheng from the University of Kentucky in CVPR 2019, Enhanced Graph Neural Network (EGNN) (or Edge GNN or Edge GraphSAGE) refers to an extension of the GraphSAGE model that incorporates information from both nodes and edges in the graph. While the original GraphSAGE focuses on aggregating information from neighboring nodes, Edge GNN takes into account the structural relationships between nodes provided by the edges.</li>\n  <li>In Edge GNN, the message-passing process considers both the features of neighboring nodes and the features of connecting edges. This allows the model to capture more fine-grained information about the relationships between nodes, such as the type or strength of the edge connection. By incorporating edge features in addition to node features, Edge GNN can learn more expressive representations that capture both node-level and edge-level information.</li>\n  <li>The Edge GNN model follows a similar iterative message-passing framework as GraphSAGE, where nodes gather and aggregate information from neighboring nodes and edges, update their representations, and propagate information across the graph. This enables the model to capture both semantic and structural information from both the local and global neighborhood of the graph and learn more comprehensive representations for nodes and edges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"embedding-generation-neural-message-passing\">Embedding Generation: Neural Message Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Generating embeddings in GNN is typically achieved through information propagation, also known as neural message passing, which involves passing information between neighboring nodes in the graph in a recursive manner, and updating the node representations based on the aggregated information.</li>\n  <li>The propagation process allows the embeddings to capture both local and global information about the nodes, and to incorporate the contextual information from their neighbors.</li>\n  <li>By generating informative and expressive embeddings, GNN-based recommenders can effectively capture the complex user-item interactions and item-item relations, and make accurate and relevant recommendations.</li>\n  <li>Neural message passing is a key technique for generating embeddings in GNN-based recommender systems. It allows the nodes in the graph to communicate with each other by passing messages along the edges, and updates their embeddings based on the aggregated information.</li>\n  <li>At a high level, the message passing process consists of two steps:\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>Message computation:</strong> In this step, each node sends a message to its neighboring nodes, which is typically computed as a function of the node’s own embedding and the embeddings of its neighbors. The message function can be a simple linear transformation, or a more complex non-linear function such as a neural network.</li>\n      <li><strong>Message aggregation:</strong> In this step, each node collects the messages from its neighbors and aggregates them to obtain a new representation of itself. The aggregation function can also be a simple sum or mean, or a more complex function such as a max-pooling or attention mechanism.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>The message passing process is usually performed recursively for a fixed number of iterations, allowing the nodes to exchange information with their neighbors and update their embeddings accordingly. The resulting embeddings capture the local and global information about the nodes, as well as the contextual information from their neighbors, which is useful for making accurate and relevant recommendations.</li>\n  <li>Some common algorithms and techniques used for neural message passing in GNNs are:\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs):</strong> GCNs apply a localized convolution operation to each node in the graph, taking into account the features of its neighboring nodes. This allows for the aggregation of information from neighboring nodes to update the node’s feature representation.</li>\n      <li><strong>Graph Attention Networks (GATs):</strong> GATs use a learnable attention mechanism to weigh the importance of neighboring nodes when updating a node’s feature representation.

    "contentMarkdown": "*   Originally proposed in [Exploiting Edge Features for Graph Neural Networks](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Gong_Exploiting_Edge_Features_for_Graph_Neural_Networks_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf) by Gong and Cheng from the University of Kentucky in CVPR 2019, Enhanced Graph Neural Network (EGNN) (or Edge GNN or Edge GraphSAGE) refers to an extension of the GraphSAGE model that incorporates information from both nodes and edges in the graph. While the original GraphSAGE focuses on aggregating information from neighboring nodes, Edge GNN takes into account the structural relationships between nodes provided by the edges.\n*   In Edge GNN, the message-passing process considers both the features of neighboring nodes and the features of connecting edges. This allows the model to capture more fine-grained information about the relationships between nodes, such as the type or strength of the edge connection. By incorporating edge features in addition to node features, Edge GNN can learn more expressive representations that capture both node-level and edge-level information.\n*   The Edge GNN model follows a similar iterative message-passing framework as GraphSAGE, where nodes gather and aggregate information from neighboring nodes and edges, update their representations, and propagate information across the graph. This enables the model to capture both semantic and structural information from both the local and global neighborhood of the graph and learn more comprehensive representations for nodes and edges.\n\n#### Embedding Generation: Neural Message Passing\n\n*   Generating embeddings in GNN is typically achieved through information propagation, also known as neural message passing, which involves passing information between neighboring nodes in the graph in a recursive manner, and updating the node representations based on the aggregated information.\n*   The propagation process allows the embeddings to capture both local and global information about the nodes, and to incorporate the contextual information from their neighbors.\n*   By generating informative and expressive embeddings, GNN-based recommenders can effectively capture the complex user-item interactions and item-item relations, and make accurate and relevant recommendations.\n*   Neural message passing is a key technique for generating embeddings in GNN-based recommender systems. It allows the nodes in the graph to communicate with each other by passing messages along the edges, and updates their embeddings based on the aggregated information.\n*   At a high level, the message passing process consists of two steps:\n    1.  **Message computation:** In this step, each node sends a message to its neighboring nodes, which is typically computed as a function of the node’s own embedding and the embeddings of its neighbors. The message function can be a simple linear transformation, or a more complex non-linear function such as a neural network.\n    2.  **Message aggregation:** In this step, each node collects the messages from its neighbors and aggregates them to obtain a new representation of itself. The aggregation function can also be a simple sum or mean, or a more complex function such as a max-pooling or attention mechanism.\n*   The message passing process is usually performed recursively for a fixed number of iterations, allowing the nodes to exchange information with their neighbors and update their embeddings accordingly. The resulting embeddings capture the local and global information about the nodes, as well as the contextual information from their neighbors, which is useful for making accurate and relevant recommendations.\n*   Some common algorithms and techniques used for neural message passing in GNNs are:\n    *   **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs):** GCNs apply a localized convolution operation to each node in the graph, taking into account the features of its neighboring nodes. This allows for the aggregation of information from neighboring nodes to update the node’s feature representation.\n    *   **Graph Attention Networks (GATs):** GATs use a learnable attention mechanism to weigh the importance of neighboring nodes when updating a node’s feature representation. This allows the model to selectively focus on the most relevant neighbors.\n    *   **GraphSAGE:** GraphSAGE uses a hierarchical sampling scheme to aggregate information from the neighborhood of each node. This allows for efficient computation of node embeddings for large graphs.\n    *   **Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs):** MPNNs use a general framework for message passing between nodes in a graph, allowing for flexibility in modeling different types of interactions.\n*   In the context of GNNs for recommender systems, the goal is to generate embeddings for the user and item nodes in the graph. The embeddings can then be used for tasks such as candidate generation, scoring, and ranking.\n*   The process of generating embeddings involves multiple GNN layers, each of which performs an exchange of information between the immediate neighbors in the graph. At each layer, the information exchanged is aggregated and processed to generate new embeddings for each node. This process can be repeated for as many layers as desired, and the number of layers determines how far information is propagated in the graph.\n*   For example, in a 2-layer GNN model, each node will receive information from its immediate neighbors (i.e., nodes connected by an edge) and its immediate neighbors’ neighbors. This allows information to be propagated beyond a node’s direct neighbors, potentially capturing higher-level structural relationships in the graph.\n*   From [Building a Recommender System Using Graph Neural Networks](https://medium.com/decathlondigital/building-a-recommender-system-using-graph-neural-networks-2ee5fc4e706d#:~:text=Typically%2C%20GNN%20recommender%20systems%20use,of%20information%20to%20learn%20from.), here is the pseudo-code for generating embeddings for a given node:\n    1.

    "contentMarkdown": "*   GNNs generate node embeddings by leveraging both the features of individual nodes and the structural information of the graph. The basic idea is to learn representations (embeddings) for nodes by aggregating information from their neighbors iteratively. Here’s an overview of how GNNs produce node embeddings.\n\n#### Input: Graph Structure and Node Features\n\n*   A graph is represented by a set of nodes VVV and edges EEE, typically denoted as G\\=(V,E)G\\=(V,E)G = (V, E).\n*   Each node v∈Vv∈Vv \\\\in V may have associated feature vectors h(0)vhv(0)h\\_v^{(0)}, which represent the initial node features. These could be properties like a node’s degree, label, or any domain-specific attributes.\n\n#### Neighborhood Aggregation: Message Passing Framework\n\n*   The core process of GNNs relies on the message-passing or neighborhood aggregation mechanism. In each layer, every node gathers and aggregates information from its neighbors to update its representation. This is done iteratively, layer by layer.\n    \n*   **Message Passing**: At each layer lll, the GNN computes a new representation (embedding) for node vvv based on its current representation h(l)vhv(l)h\\_v^{(l)} and the representations of its neighbors.

In each layer, every node gathers and aggregates information from its neighbors to update its representation.

    "contentMarkdown": "*   Different Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures differ in how they perform the aggregate and update step. The core idea in each of them is to combine (or aggregate) information from a node’s neighbors and then update the node’s embedding. However, the specifics of how they carry out this update vary depending on the architecture. Here’s a detailed comparison.\n\n#### Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)\n\n*   **Aggregation**: GCNs aggregate neighbor information by averaging (weighted by node degree for normalization) the features of the neighbors.\n*   **Update Step**: After aggregation, GCNs update the node embeddings by applying a linear transformation (learned weight matrix) followed by a non-linear activation function (like ReLU). Mathematically, this can be written as:\n    \n    h(l+1)v\\=σ⎛⎝⎜⎜W(l)⋅∑u∈(v)1dvdu‾‾‾‾√h(l)u⎞⎠⎟⎟hv(l+1)\\=σ(W(l)⋅∑u∈N(v)1dvduhu(l))\n    \n    h\\_v^{(l+1)} = \\\\sigma \\\\left( W^{(l)} \\\\cdot \\\\sum\\_{u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(v)} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d\\_v d\\_u}} h\\_u^{(l)} \\\\right)\n    *   where:\n        *   h(l+1)vhv(l+1)h\\_v^{(l+1)} is the updated embedding of node vvv at layer l+1l+1l+1.\n        *   W(l)W(l)W^{(l)} is the learnable weight matrix for layer lll.\n        *   σσ\\\\sigma is a non-linear activation (e.g., ReLU).\n        *   (v)N(v)\\\\mathcal{N}(v) represents the neighbors of node vvv.\n        *   dvdvd\\_v and dudud\\_u are the degrees of nodes vvv and uuu, respectively (used for normalization).\n*   In GCNs, the update step is fairly straightforward: aggregate, normalize, apply a linear transformation, and pass through an activation function.\n\n**Update Step**: After aggregation, GCNs update the node embeddings by applying a linear transformation (learned weight matrix) followed by a non-linear activation function (like ReLU). Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\n*   where:\n    *   h(l+1)vhv(l+1)h\\_v^{(l+1)} is the updated embedding of node vvv at layer l+1l+1l+1.\n    *   W(l)W(l)W^{(l)} is the learnable weight matrix for layer lll.\n    *   σσ\\\\sigma is a non-linear activation (e.g., ReLU).\n    *   (v)N(v)\\\\mathcal{N}(v) represents the neighbors of node vvv.\n    *   dvdvd\\_v and dudud\\_u are the degrees of nodes vvv and uuu, respectively (used for normalization).\n\n*   h(l+1)vhv(l+1)h\\_v^{(l+1)} is the updated embedding of node vvv at layer l+1l+1l+1.\n*   W(l)W(l)W^{(l)} is the learnable weight matrix for layer lll.\n*   σσ\\\\sigma is a non-linear activation (e.g., ReLU).\n*   (v)N(v)\\\\mathcal{N}(v) represents the neighbors of node vvv.\n*   dvdvd\\_v and dudud\\_u are the degrees of nodes vvv and uuu, respectively (used for normalization).\n\n#### GraphSAGE\n\n*   **Aggregation**: GraphSAGE aggregates neighbor information using different possible functions like:\n*   **Mean aggregation**: Similar to GCN, the mean of the neighbors’ features is taken.\n*   **Max-pooling aggregation**: Applies a pooling operation (e.g., taking the maximum value across features).\n*   **LSTM-based aggregation**: Uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to aggregate the neighbors’ features.\n*   **Update Step**: After aggregation, GraphSAGE updates the node embeddings by concatenating the node’s own current embedding with the aggregated information from its neighbors. This concatenated vector is then passed through a fully connected layer to update the node embedding: h(l+1)v\\=σ(W(l)⋅CONCAT(h(l)v,AGGREGATE({h(l)u:u∈(v)})))hv(l+1)\\=σ(W(l)⋅CONCAT(hv(l),AGGREGATE({hu(l):u∈N(v)})))h\\_v^{(l+1)} = \\\\sigma \\\\left( W^{(l)} \\\\cdot \\\\text{CONCAT}(h\\_v^{(l)}, \\\\text{AGGREGATE}(\\\\{ h\\_u^{(l)} : u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(v) \\\\})) \\\\right)\n    *   where, the concatenation of the node’s own embedding h(l)vhv(l)h\\_v^{(l)} with the aggregated neighbor information helps retain both the node’s original features and its local neighborhood context.\n\n*   where, the concatenation of the node’s own embedding h(l)vhv(l)h\\_v^{(l)} with the aggregated neighbor information helps retain both the node’s original features and its local neighborhood context.\n\nGraphSAGE differs from GCN by using more flexible aggregation strategies and by concatenating the node’s current embedding with the neighborhood’s aggregated information.\n\n#### Graph Attention Networks (GATs)\n\n*   **Aggregation**: GATs introduce an attention mechanism to aggregate neighbor information. Instead of treating all neighbors equally (like GCN), GATs assign different weights (attention scores) to different neighbors based on their relative importance. The attention score αvuαvu\\\\alpha\\_{vu} between nodes vvv and uuu is learned using a feedforward neural network and normalized using the softmax function: αvu\\=softmaxu(LeakyReLU(aT\\[W(l)h(l)v||W(l)h(l)u\\]))αvu\\=softmaxu(LeakyReLU(aT\\[W(l)hv(l)||W(l)hu(l)\\]))\\\\alpha\\_{vu} = \\\\text{softmax}\\_u \\\\left( \\\\text{LeakyReLU} \\\\left( a^T \\[W^{(l)} h\\_v^{(l)} || W^{(l)} h\\_u^{(l)}\\] \\\\right) \\\\right)\n    *   where:\n        *   aaa is a learnable vector.\n        *   $$\n            \n             \n            \n            $$ denotes concatenation.\n            \n*   **Update Step**: After calculating the attention scores αvuαvu\\\\alpha\\_{vu}, GATs compute a weighted sum of the neighbors’ features based on these attention scores. The node embedding is then updated as follows: h(l+1)v\\=σ(∑u∈(v)αvuW(l)h(l)u)hv(l+1)\\=σ(∑u∈N(v)αvuW(l)hu(l))h\\_v^{(l+1)} = \\\\sigma \\\\left( \\\\sum\\_{u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(v)} \\\\alpha\\_{vu} W^{(l)} h\\_u^{(l)} \\\\right)\n    \n*   In GATs, the update step relies heavily on the attention mechanism, which dynamically adjusts the importance of each neighbor during aggregation.\n*   GATs differ significantly from GCNs and GraphSAGE by learning a weighting mechanism (attention) that dictates how much influence each neighbor has on a node’s updated embedding.\n\n*   where:\n    *   aaa is a learnable vector.\n    *   $$\n        \n         \n        \n        $$ denotes concatenation.\n        \n\n*   aaa is a learnable vector.\n*   $$\n    \n     \n    \n    $$ denotes concatenation.\n    \n\n$$\n\n \n\n$$ denotes concatenation.\n\n**Update Step**: After calculating the attention scores αvuαvu\\\\alpha\\_{vu}, GATs compute a weighted sum of the neighbors’ features based on these attention scores. The node embedding is then updated as follows: h(l+1)v\\=σ(∑u∈(v)αvuW(l)h(l)u)hv(l+1)\\=σ(∑u∈N(v)αvuW(l)hu(l))h\\_v^{(l+1)} = \\\\sigma \\\\left( \\\\sum\\_{u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(v)} \\\\alpha\\_{vu} W^{(l)} h\\_u^{(l)} \\\\right)\n\n#### Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs)\n\n*   **Aggregation**: MPNNs provide a general framework for message passing in GNNs. The aggregation step in MPNNs can be highly flexible and depends on the specific design of the message-passing function. In general, each node receives a “message” from its neighbors based on their embeddings and any associated edge features: m(l+1)v\\=∑u∈(v)MESSAGE(h(l)v,h(l)u,evu)mv(l+1)\\=∑u∈N(v)MESSAGE(hv(l),hu(l),evu)m\\_v^{(l+1)} = \\\\sum\\_{u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(v)} \\\\text{MESSAGE}(h\\_v^{(l)}, h\\_u^{(l)}, e\\_{vu})\n    *   where, evuevue\\_{vu} represents any features associated with the edge between nodes vvv and uuu.\n*   **Update Step**: The node embedding is updated by applying an update function (like a GRU, LSTM, or a simple neural network layer) to the aggregated message:\n\n*   where, evuevue\\_{vu} represents any features associated with the edge between nodes vvv and uuu.\n\nh(l+1)v\\=UPDATE(h(l)v,m(l+1)v)hv(l+1)\\=UPDATE(hv(l),mv(l+1))\n\n*   The update step in MPNNs is highly customizable and can involve various functions such as gated recurrent units (GRU), LSTM, or even a simple fully connected layer. This allows MPNNs to handle different types of tasks and graph structures.\n*   The key difference in MPNNs is that both the message-passing function and the update function are flexible and can be designed in various ways, allowing for more expressive modeling compared to GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT.\n\n#### Summary of Differences in the Update Step\n\n*   **GCNs**: Update by applying a linear transformation (weight matrix) and non-linearity after averaging neighbor features (with normalization).\n*   **GraphSAGE**: Update by concatenating the node’s own embedding with the aggregated neighbor features (using mean, max-pooling, or LSTM) and passing through a fully connected layer.\n*   **GATs**: Update by calculating attention scores to weight the neighbors’ features before applying a linear transformation and non-linearity.\n*   **MPNNs**: Update via a flexible update function (such as GRU, LSTM, or a neural network layer) applied to aggregated messages from neighbors, with customizable message-passing mechanisms.\n*   Each architecture has its strengths and trade-offs depending on the type of graph data and the task at hand.",

    "contentMarkdown": "*   Many GNN architectures extend the basic message-passing framework to include edge features or edge embeddings. In these cases, the message from one node to another is influenced not only by the source node’s features but also by the features of the edge connecting them.\n*   The message-passing function in a GNN that uses edge features or edge embeddings typically takes the following form: m(l)v→u\\=MESSAGE(h(l)v,h(l)u,evu)mv→u(l)\\=MESSAGE(hv(l),hu(l),evu)m\\_{v \\\\to u}^{(l)} = \\\\text{MESSAGE}(h\\_v^{(l)}, h\\_u^{(l)}, e\\_{vu})\n    *   where:\n        *   h(l)vhv(l)h\\_v^{(l)} is the embedding of node vvv at layer lll,\n        *   h(l)uhu(l)h\\_u^{(l)} is the embedding of node uuu at layer lll,\n        *   evuevue\\_{vu} is the embedding or feature vector of the edge between nodes vvv and uuu.\n*   The message is computed using both the node features and the edge features, where the edge feature provides additional context about the relationship between the two nodes.\n*   Example: If the edge represents a physical connection between two devices (nodes), the edge feature might represent bandwidth or latency. This additional information can modify how much or in what way the node aggregates messages from its neighbors.\n\n*   where:\n    *   h(l)vhv(l)h\\_v^{(l)} is the embedding of node vvv at layer lll,\n    *   h(l)uhu(l)h\\_u^{(l)} is the embedding of node uuu at layer lll,\n    *   evuevue\\_{vu} is the embedding or feature vector of the edge between nodes vvv and uuu.\n\n*   h(l)vhv(l)h\\_v^{(l)} is the embedding of node vvv at layer lll,\n*   h(l)uhu(l)h\\_u^{(l)} is the embedding of node uuu at layer lll,\n*   evuevue\\_{vu} is the embedding or feature vector of the edge between nodes vvv and uuu.",

    "contentMarkdown": "#### Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs)\n\n*   MPNNs explicitly allow for edge embeddings during message passing. The message-passing function in MPNNs includes edge features, which are incorporated as follows: m(l)v→u\\=f(h(l)v,h(l)u,evu)mv→u(l)\\=f(hv(l),hu(l),evu)m\\_{v \\\\to u}^{(l)} = f(h\\_v^{(l)}, h\\_u^{(l)}, e\\_{vu})\n    *   where, the function fff can be a neural network or another learnable function that combines the node embeddings and edge embeddings. The edge features are treated as part of the input to compute the message, influencing how much of node vvv’s information gets passed to node uuu.\n\n*   where, the function fff can be a neural network or another learnable function that combines the node embeddings and edge embeddings. The edge features are treated as part of the input to compute the message, influencing how much of node vvv’s information gets passed to node uuu.\n\n#### Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Edge Features\n\n*   GATs use an attention mechanism to compute how much attention a node should pay to each of its neighbors. In cases where edge features are present, these can be incorporated into the attention score calculation. The attention mechanism might look like this: αvu\\=softmaxu(LeakyReLU(aT\\[W(l)h(l)v||W(l)h(l)u||evu\\]))αvu\\=softmaxu(LeakyReLU(aT\\[W(l)hv(l)||W(l)hu(l)||evu\\]))\\\\alpha\\_{vu} = \\\\text{softmax}\\_u \\\\left( \\\\text{LeakyReLU}(a^T \\[W^{(l)} h\\_v^{(l)} || W^{(l)} h\\_u^{(l)} || e\\_{vu}\\]) \\\\right)\n    *   where, the edge embedding evuevue\\_{vu} is concatenated with the node features and used to compute the attention score αvuαvu\\\\alpha\\_{vu}. This allows the model to learn different levels of importance based on the edge characteristics.\n\n*   where, the edge embedding evuevue\\_{vu} is concatenated with the node features and used to compute the attention score αvuαvu\\\\alpha\\_{vu}. This allows the model to learn different levels of importance based on the edge characteristics.\n\n#### Edge-Conditioned Convolution (ECC)\n\n*   In the Edge-Conditioned Convolution (ECC) variant of GNNs, the edge features are used to modulate the weights of the convolutional filters dynamically. The weight matrix WvuWvuW\\_{vu} used in the aggregation process is a function of the edge feature evuevue\\_{vu}: Wvu\\=g(evu;θ)Wvu\\=g(evu;θ)W\\_{vu} = g(e\\_{vu}; \\\\theta)\n    *   where, ggg is a learnable function (like a neural network) that generates the weights based on the edge embedding evuevue\\_{vu}. The edge features directly influence how messages are propagated and aggregated across the graph.\n\n*   where, ggg is a learnable function (like a neural network) that generates the weights based on the edge embedding evuevue\\_{vu}.

In such cases, edge embeddings (or learned edge features) can be used to represent relationships between pairs of nodes, based on their node embeddings.

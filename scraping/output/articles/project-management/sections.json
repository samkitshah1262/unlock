    "contentHtml": "<ul>\n  <li>One of the key aspects of Agile is iterative development. Instead of delivering an entire product at once, Agile teams develop the product incrementally. The project is broken down into smaller units of work (sometimes referred to as user stories, tasks, or features) that can be developed, tested, and delivered within short time frames, often referred to as iterations or sprints.</li>\n  <li>Each iteration should produce a potentially shippable product increment—something tangible that can be demonstrated to stakeholders and customers. This approach ensures that the team can quickly adapt to changes based on real-time feedback, reducing the risk of developing something that doesn’t meet the user’s needs or is no longer relevant due to changing market conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"agile-teams\">Agile Teams</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Agile teams are cross-functional, meaning that all the skills necessary to deliver a working product increment are present within the team. This typically includes roles such as developers, testers, designers, and sometimes business analysts or domain experts.</li>\n  <li>A key characteristic of Agile teams is self-organization. Teams have the autonomy to decide how best to accomplish the work they’ve committed to, and they are empowered to make decisions about technical implementation, task prioritization, and collaboration. Managers play more of a supportive role, removing obstacles and providing resources, rather than directing day-to-day tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"benefits-of-agile-project-management\">Benefits of Agile Project Management</h4>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Customer-Centric Approach</strong>: Agile involves frequent customer interaction, allowing teams to gather valuable feedback and ensure that the product or service being developed aligns with customer expectations.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Flexibility and Adaptability</strong>: Agile is designed to accommodate change.

    "contentMarkdown": "*   One of the key aspects of Agile is iterative development. Instead of delivering an entire product at once, Agile teams develop the product incrementally. The project is broken down into smaller units of work (sometimes referred to as user stories, tasks, or features) that can be developed, tested, and delivered within short time frames, often referred to as iterations or sprints.\n*   Each iteration should produce a potentially shippable product increment—something tangible that can be demonstrated to stakeholders and customers. This approach ensures that the team can quickly adapt to changes based on real-time feedback, reducing the risk of developing something that doesn’t meet the user’s needs or is no longer relevant due to changing market conditions.\n\n#### Agile Teams\n\n*   Agile teams are cross-functional, meaning that all the skills necessary to deliver a working product increment are present within the team. This typically includes roles such as developers, testers, designers, and sometimes business analysts or domain experts.\n*   A key characteristic of Agile teams is self-organization. Teams have the autonomy to decide how best to accomplish the work they’ve committed to, and they are empowered to make decisions about technical implementation, task prioritization, and collaboration. Managers play more of a supportive role, removing obstacles and providing resources, rather than directing day-to-day tasks.\n\n#### Benefits of Agile Project Management\n\n1.  **Customer-Centric Approach**: Agile involves frequent customer interaction, allowing teams to gather valuable feedback and ensure that the product or service being developed aligns with customer expectations.\n    \n2.  **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Agile is designed to accommodate change.

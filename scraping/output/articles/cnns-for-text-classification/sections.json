With the [**RGB colour mode**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/RGB_color_model) each pixel would be a combination of three intensity values instead, one for each of Red, Green and Blue components, and such representation would be stored in three different matrices, providing different characteristics or view of the image, referred to as a [**Channel**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Channel_\\(digital_image\\)). It’s common to apply a different set of filters to each channel, and then combine the three resulting vectors into a single vector.\n    \n*   We can also apply the multiple channels paradigm in text processing as well.

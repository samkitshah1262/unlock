This flexibility enhances communication while minimizing vocabulary load.\n    \n\n**Multiple Related Meanings**: A polysemous word carries several senses that stem from a shared semantic root or conceptual metaphor.\n\n*   **Example:** _Bank_ can refer to:\n    \n    *   a financial institution (_I deposited money in the bank_),\n    *   the side of a river (_We walked along the river bank_).\n*   Despite differing domains, both meanings involve the concept of accumulation — of money or land — showing a conceptual link rather than arbitrary coincidence.\n    \n\n**Example:** _Bank_ can refer to:\n\n*   a financial institution (_I deposited money in the bank_),\n*   the side of a river (_We walked along the river bank_).\n\nDespite differing domains, both meanings involve the concept of accumulation — of money or land — showing a conceptual link rather than arbitrary coincidence.\n\n**Semantic Extension**: New meanings of polysemous words often evolve through **metaphorical** or **functional** extensions of an existing sense.\n\n*   **Example:** _Head_:\n    \n    *   **Literal:** part of the human body (_She nodded her head_),\n    *   **Metaphorical:** leader of a group (_the head of the company_),\n    *   **Functional:** the front or top of something (_the head of the line_).\n*   Each new sense maintains a logical or spatial connection to the core concept of _top_ or _control_.\n    \n\n**Example:** _Head_:\n\n*   **Literal:** part of the human body (_She nodded her head_),\n*   **Metaphorical:** leader of a group (_the head of the company_),\n*   **Functional:** the front or top of something (_the head of the line_).\n\nEach new sense maintains a logical or spatial connection to the core concept of _top_ or _control_.\n\n**Context-Dependent Interpretation**: The correct sense of a polysemous word depends on the **context** in which it appears.\n\n*   **Example:** _Run_:\n    \n    *   Movement (_She runs every morning_),\n    *   Operation (_The engine runs smoothly_),\n    *   Management (_He runs the business_).\n*   The surrounding words and syntax determine which sense is activated.\n    \n\n**Example:** _Run_:\n\n*   Movement (_She runs every morning_),\n*   Operation (_The engine runs smoothly_),\n*   Management (_He runs the business_).\n\nThe surrounding words and syntax determine which sense is activated.\n\n**Cognitive Efficiency**: Polysemy demonstrates the **economy of language**, where existing lexical forms are reused for conceptually related meanings rather than inventing new words for every nuance. This flexibility enhances communication while minimizing vocabulary load.\n\n#### Linguistic and Computational Relevance\n\n*   In **linguistics**, polysemy illustrates how meaning evolves through **metaphor, metonymy, and conceptual mapping**, making it central to studies of semantic change.\n*   In **computational linguistics and NLP**, polysemy introduces **word sense ambiguity** — a major challenge in embedding and translation models. Traditional word embeddings like Word2Vec assign **one vector per word**, merging multiple senses (e.g., _bank_ as finance and geography), while contextual models like **BERT** dynamically adjust meaning based on context, successfully distinguishing different senses of the same word.",

This independence assumption ignores any potential relationships or dependencies between words, which can be crucial for understanding context and meaning.\n\n##### Scalability Issues\n\n*   **Computational Inefficiency:** As the size of the corpus increases, the vocabulary size also increases, leading to scalability issues. High-dimensional vectors require more computational resources for processing, storing, and analyzing the data.\n\n##### No Weighting Mechanism\n\n*   **Equal Importance:** In its simplest form, BoW treats all words with equal importance, which is not always appropriate. Common but less informative words (e.g., “the”, “is”) are treated the same as more informative words (e.g., “cat”, “bank”).\n\n##### Lack of Generalization\n\n*   **Poor Performance on Short Texts:** BoW can be particularly ineffective for short texts or documents with limited content, where the lack of context and the sparse nature of the vector representation can lead to poor performance.\n\n##### Examples of Limitations\n\n*   **Example of Lack of Contextual Information:**\n    *   Consider two sentences: “Apple is looking at buying a U.K. startup.” and “Startup is looking at buying an Apple.” Both would have similar BoW representations but convey different meanings.\n*   **Example of High Dimensionality and Sparsity:**\n    *   A corpus with 100,000 unique words results in BoW vectors of dimension 100,000, most of which would be zeros for any given document.\n\n*   Consider two sentences: “Apple is looking at buying a U.K. startup.” and “Startup is looking at buying an Apple.” Both would have similar BoW representations but convey different meanings.\n\n*   A corpus with 100,000 unique words results in BoW vectors of dimension 100,000, most of which would be zeros for any given document.\n\n##### Summary\n\n*   While BoW embeddings provide a straightforward and intuitive way to represent text data, their limitations make them less suitable for complex NLP tasks that require understanding context, handling large vocabularies efficiently, or dealing with semantic and syntactic nuances. More advanced techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText), and contextual embeddings (e.g., ELMo, BERT) address many of these limitations by incorporating context, reducing dimensionality, and capturing richer semantic information.",

    "contentHtml": "<ul>\n  <li>Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus. It is a fundamental technique in text processing that ranks the relevance of documents to a specific query, commonly applied in tasks such as document classification, search engine ranking, information retrieval, and text mining.</li>\n  <li>The TF-IDF value increases proportionally with the number of times a word appears in the document, but this is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to control for the fact that some words (e.g., “the”, “is”, “and”) are generally more common than others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"term-frequency-tf\">Term Frequency (TF)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Term Frequency measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is often divided by the document length (the total number of terms in the document) as a way of normalization:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"MathJax_Display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"MathJax\" id=\"MathJax-Element-6-Frame\" tabindex=\"0\" data-mathml=\"<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;block&quot;><mtext>TF(t)</mtext><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mtext>Number of times term&amp;#xA0;</mtext><mi>t</mi><mtext>&amp;#xA0;appears in a document</mtext></mrow><mtext>Total number of terms in the document</mtext></mfrac></math>\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: center; position: relative;\"><nobr aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"math\" id=\"MathJax-Span-18\" style=\"width: 26.773em; display: inline-block;\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 22.294em; height: 0px; font-size: 120%;\"><span style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(0.68em, 1022.29em, 3.023em, -999.997em); top: -2.185em; left: 0em;\"><span class=\"mrow\" id=\"MathJax-Span-19\"><span class=\"mtext\" id=\"MathJax-Span-20\" style=\"font-family: STIXGeneral-Regular;\">TF(t)</span><span class=\"mo\" id=\"MathJax-Span-21\" style=\"font-family: STIXGeneral-Regular; padding-left: 0.315em;\">=</span><span class=\"mfrac\" id=\"MathJax-Span-22\" style=\"padding-left: 0.315em;\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 18.753em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.107em; margin-left: 0.107em;\"><span style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(3.18em, 1018.65em, 4.378em, -999.997em); top: -4.685em; left: 50%; margin-left: -9.32em;\"><span class=\"mrow\" id=\"MathJax-Span-23\"><span class=\"mtext\" id=\"MathJax-Span-24\" style=\"font-family: STIXGeneral-Regular;\">Number of times term&nbsp;</span><span class=\"mi\" id=\"MathJax-Span-25\" style=\"font-family: STIXGeneral-Italic;\">t<span style=\"display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; height: 1px; width: 0.003em;\"></span></span><span class=\"mtext\" id=\"MathJax-Span-26\" style=\"font-family: STIXGeneral-Regular;\">&nbsp;appears in a document</span></span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 4.013em;\"></span></span><span style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(3.18em, 1015.68em, 4.169em, -999.997em); top: -3.331em; left: 50%; margin-left: -7.81em;\"><span class=\"mtext\" id=\"MathJax-Span-27\" style=\"font-family: STIXGeneral-Regular;\">Total number of terms in the document</span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 4.013em;\"></span></span><span style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(0.836em, 1018.75em, 1.201em, -999.997em); top: -1.247em; left: 0em;\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 18.753em; height: 0px;\"></span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.044em;\"></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.19em;\"></span></span></span><span style=\"display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.872em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 2.628em;\"></span></span></nobr><span class=\"MJX_Assistive_MathML MJX_Assistive_MathML_Block\" role=\"presentation\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"><mtext>TF(t)</mtext><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mtext>Number of times term&nbsp;</mtext><mi>t</mi><mtext>&nbsp;appears in a document</mtext></mrow><mtext>Total number of terms in the document</mtext></mfrac></math></span></span></div>\n<h4 id=\"inverse-document-frequency-idf\">Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Inverse Document Frequency measures how important a term is.

This has led to the development and adoption of more advanced techniques like word embeddings and neural network-based models in NLP.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"lack-of-context-and-word-order\">Lack of Context and Word Order</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>TF-IDF treats each word in a document independently and does not consider the context in which a word appears. This means it cannot capture the meaning of words based on their surrounding words or the overall semantic structure of the text. The word order is also ignored, which can be crucial in understanding the meaning of a sentence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"does-not-account-for-polysemy\">Does Not Account for Polysemy</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>Words with multiple meanings (polysemy) are treated the same regardless of their context. For example, the word “bank” would have the same representation in “river bank” and “savings bank”, even though it has different meanings in these contexts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"lack-of-semantic-understanding\">Lack of Semantic Understanding</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>TF-IDF relies purely on the statistical occurrence of words in documents, which means it lacks any understanding of the semantics of the words. It cannot capture synonyms or related terms unless they appear in similar documents within the corpus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"bias-towards-rare-terms\">Bias Towards Rare Terms</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>While the IDF component of TF-IDF aims to balance the frequency of terms, it can sometimes overly emphasize rare terms. This might lead to overvaluing words that appear infrequently but are not necessarily more relevant or important in the context of the document.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"vocabulary-limitation\">Vocabulary Limitation</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>The TF-IDF model is limited to the vocabulary of the corpus it was trained on. It cannot handle new words that were not in the training corpus, making it less effective for dynamic content or languages that evolve rapidly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"normalization-issues\">Normalization Issues</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>The normalization process in TF-IDF (e.g., dividing by the total number of words in a document) may not always be effective in balancing document lengths and word frequencies, potentially leading to skewed results.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"requires-a-large-and-representative-corpus\">Requires a Large and Representative Corpus</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>For the IDF part of TF-IDF to be effective, it needs a large and representative corpus. If the corpus is not representative of the language or the domain of interest, the IDF scores may not accurately reflect the importance of the words.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"no-distinction-between-different-types-of-documents\">No Distinction Between Different Types of Documents</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>TF-IDF treats all documents in the corpus equally, without considering the type or quality of the documents. This means that all sources are considered equally authoritative, which may not be the case.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"poor-performance-with-short-texts\">Poor Performance with Short Texts</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>In very short documents, like tweets or SMS messages, the TF-IDF scores can be less meaningful because of the limited word occurrence and context.</li>\n</ul>",
    "contentMarkdown": "*   Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus. It is a fundamental technique in text processing that ranks the relevance of documents to a specific query, commonly applied in tasks such as document classification, search engine ranking, information retrieval, and text mining.\n*   The TF-IDF value increases proportionally with the number of times a word appears in the document, but this is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to control for the fact that some words (e.g., “the”, “is”, “and”) are generally more common than others.\n\n#### Term Frequency (TF)\n\n*   Term Frequency measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is often divided by the document length (the total number of terms in the document) as a way of normalization:\n\nTF(t)\\=Number of times term t appears in a documentTotal number of terms in the documentTF(t)\\=Number of times term t appears in a documentTotal number of terms in the document\n\n#### Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\n\n*   Inverse Document Frequency measures how important a term is. While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However, certain terms, like “is”, “of”, and “that”, may appear a lot of times but have little importance. Thus, we need to weigh down the frequent terms while scaling up the rare ones, by computing the following:\n\nIDF(t)\\=log(Total number of documentsNumber of documents with term t in it)IDF(t)\\=log⁡(Total number of documentsNumber of documents with term t in it)\n\n#### Example\n\n##### Steps to Calculate TF-IDF\n\n1.  _Step 1:_ **TF (Term Frequency):** Number of times a word appears in a document divided by the total number of words in that document.\n2.  _Step 2:_ **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency):** Calculated as `log(N / df)`, where:\n    *   `N` is the total number of documents in the collection.\n    *   `df` is the number of documents containing the word.\n3.  _Step 3:_ **TF-IDF:** The product of TF and IDF.\n\n*   `N` is the total number of documents in the collection.\n*   `df` is the number of documents containing the word.\n\n##### Document Collection\n\n*   **Doc 1:** “The sky is blue.”\n*   **Doc 2:** “The sun is bright.”\n*   Total documents (`N`): 2\n\n##### Calculate Term Frequency (TF)\n\n**Word**\n\n**TF in Doc 1 (\"The sky is blue\")**\n\n**TF in Doc 2 (\"The sun is bright\")**\n\nthe\n\n1/4\n\n1/5\n\nsky\n\n1/4\n\n0/5\n\nis\n\n1/4\n\n1/5\n\nblue\n\n1/4\n\n0/5\n\nsun\n\n0/4\n\n1/5\n\nbright\n\n0/4\n\n1/5\n\n**Word**\n\n**TF in Doc 1 (\"The sky is blue\")**\n\n**TF in Doc 2 (\"The sun is bright\")**\n\nthe\n\n1/4\n\n1/5\n\nsky\n\n1/4\n\n0/5\n\nis\n\n1/4\n\n1/5\n\nblue\n\n1/4\n\n0/5\n\nsun\n\n0/4\n\n1/5\n\nbright\n\n0/4\n\n1/5\n\n##### Calculate Document Frequency (DF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\n\n**Word**\n\n**DF (in how many docs)**\n\n**IDF (log(N/DF))**\n\nthe\n\n2\n\nlog(2/2) = 0\n\nsky\n\n1\n\nlog(2/1) ≈ 0.693\n\nis\n\n2\n\nlog(2/2) = 0\n\nblue\n\n1\n\nlog(2/1) ≈ 0.693\n\nsun\n\n1\n\nlog(2/1) ≈ 0.693\n\nbright\n\n1\n\nlog(2/1) ≈ 0.693\n\n**Word**\n\n**DF (in how many docs)**\n\n**IDF (log(N/DF))**\n\nthe\n\n2\n\nlog(2/2) = 0\n\nsky\n\n1\n\nlog(2/1) ≈ 0.693\n\nis\n\n2\n\nlog(2/2) = 0\n\nblue\n\n1\n\nlog(2/1) ≈ 0.693\n\nsun\n\n1\n\nlog(2/1) ≈ 0.693\n\nbright\n\n1\n\nlog(2/1) ≈ 0.693\n\n##### Calculate TF-IDF for Each Word\n\n**Word**\n\n**TF in Doc 1**\n\n**IDF**\n\n**TF-IDF in Doc 1**\n\n**TF in Doc 2**\n\n**IDF**\n\n**TF-IDF in Doc 2**\n\nthe\n\n1/4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1/5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nsky\n\n1/4\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n(1/4) \\* 0.693 ≈ 0.173\n\n0/5\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n0\n\nis\n\n1/4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1/5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nblue\n\n1/4\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n(1/4) \\* 0.693 ≈ 0.173\n\n0/5\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n0\n\nsun\n\n0/4\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n0\n\n1/5\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n(1/5) \\* 0.693 ≈ 0.139\n\nbright\n\n0/4\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n0\n\n1/5\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n(1/5) \\* 0.693 ≈ 0.139\n\n**Word**\n\n**TF in Doc 1**\n\n**IDF**\n\n**TF-IDF in Doc 1**\n\n**TF in Doc 2**\n\n**IDF**\n\n**TF-IDF in Doc 2**\n\nthe\n\n1/4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1/5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nsky\n\n1/4\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n(1/4) \\* 0.693 ≈ 0.173\n\n0/5\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n0\n\nis\n\n1/4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1/5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nblue\n\n1/4\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n(1/4) \\* 0.693 ≈ 0.173\n\n0/5\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n0\n\nsun\n\n0/4\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n0\n\n1/5\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n(1/5) \\* 0.693 ≈ 0.139\n\nbright\n\n0/4\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n0\n\n1/5\n\nlog(2) ≈ 0.693\n\n(1/5) \\* 0.693 ≈ 0.139\n\n##### Explanation of Table\n\n*   The **TF** column shows the term frequency for each word in each document.\n*   The **IDF** column shows the inverse document frequency for each word.\n*   The **TF-IDF** columns for Doc 1 and Doc 2 show the final TF-IDF score for each word, calculated as `TF * IDF`.\n\n##### Key Observations\n\n*   Words like “the” and “is” have an IDF of 0 because they appear in both documents, making them less distinctive.\n*   Words like “blue,” “sun,” and “bright” have higher TF-IDF values because they appear in only one document, making them more distinctive for that document.\n    *   The TF-IDF score for “blue” in Doc 1 is thus a measure of its importance in that document, within the context of the given document collection. This score would be different in a different document or a different collection, reflecting the term’s varying importance.\n\n*   The TF-IDF score for “blue” in Doc 1 is thus a measure of its importance in that document, within the context of the given document collection. This score would be different in a different document or a different collection, reflecting the term’s varying importance.\n\n#### Limitations of TF-IDF\n\n*   While TF-IDF is a powerful tool for certain applications, the limitations highlighted below make it less suitable for tasks that require deep understanding of language, such as semantic search, word sense disambiguation, or processing of very short or dynamically changing texts. This has led to the development and adoption of more advanced techniques like word embeddings and neural network-based models in NLP.\n\n##### Lack of Context and Word Order\n\n*   TF-IDF treats each word in a document independently and does not consider the context in which a word appears. This means it cannot capture the meaning of words based on their surrounding words or the overall semantic structure of the text. The word order is also ignored, which can be crucial in understanding the meaning of a sentence.\n\n##### Does Not Account for Polysemy\n\n*   Words with multiple meanings (polysemy) are treated the same regardless of their context. For example, the word “bank” would have the same representation in “river bank” and “savings bank”, even though it has different meanings in these contexts.\n\n##### Lack of Semantic Understanding\n\n*   TF-IDF relies purely on the statistical occurrence of words in documents, which means it lacks any understanding of the semantics of the words. It cannot capture synonyms or related terms unless they appear in similar documents within the corpus.\n\n##### Bias Towards Rare Terms\n\n*   While the IDF component of TF-IDF aims to balance the frequency of terms, it can sometimes overly emphasize rare terms. This might lead to overvaluing words that appear infrequently but are not necessarily more relevant or important in the context of the document.\n\n##### Vocabulary Limitation\n\n*   The TF-IDF model is limited to the vocabulary of the corpus it was trained on. It cannot handle new words that were not in the training corpus, making it less effective for dynamic content or languages that evolve rapidly.\n\n##### Normalization Issues\n\n*   The normalization process in TF-IDF (e.g., dividing by the total number of words in a document) may not always be effective in balancing document lengths and word frequencies, potentially leading to skewed results.\n\n##### Requires a Large and Representative Corpus\n\n*   For the IDF part of TF-IDF to be effective, it needs a large and representative corpus. If the corpus is not representative of the language or the domain of interest, the IDF scores may not accurately reflect the importance of the words.\n\n##### No Distinction Between Different Types of Documents\n\n*   TF-IDF treats all documents in the corpus equally, without considering the type or quality of the documents. This means that all sources are considered equally authoritative, which may not be the case.\n\n##### Poor Performance with Short Texts\n\n*   In very short documents, like tweets or SMS messages, the TF-IDF scores can be less meaningful because of the limited word occurrence and context.",

It’s a part of the family of probabilistic information retrieval models and is an extension of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) approach, though it introduces several improvements and modifications.\n\n#### Key Components of BM25\n\n1.  **Term Frequency (TF)**: BM25 modifies the term frequency component of TF-IDF to address the issue of term saturation. In TF-IDF, the more frequently a term appears in a document, the more it is considered relevant. However, this can lead to a problem where beyond a certain point, additional occurrences of a term don’t really indicate more relevance. BM25 addresses this by using a logarithmic scale for term frequency, which allows for a point of diminishing returns, preventing a term’s frequency from having an unbounded impact on the document’s relevance.\n    \n2.  **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Like TF-IDF, BM25 includes an IDF component, which helps to weight a term’s importance based on how rare or common it is across all documents. The idea is that terms that appear in many documents are less informative than those that appear in fewer documents.\n    \n3.  **Document Length Normalization**: BM25 introduces a sophisticated way of handling document length. Unlike TF-IDF, which may unfairly penalize longer documents, BM25 normalizes for length in a more balanced manner, reducing the impact of document length on the calculation of relevance.\n    \n4.  **Tunable Parameters**: BM25 includes parameters like k1k1k1 and bbb, which can be adjusted to optimize performance for specific datasets and needs. k1k1k1 controls how quickly an increase in term frequency leads to term saturation, and bbb controls the degree of length normalization.\n    \n\n**Term Frequency (TF)**: BM25 modifies the term frequency component of TF-IDF to address the issue of term saturation.

The relevance of the terms is balanced against the length of the document.\n*   So, despite Document B having more mentions of “solar energy”, BM25 will calculate the relevance of both documents in a way that balances term frequency, term rarity, and document length, potentially ranking them differently based on how these factors interplay. The final relevance scores would then determine their ranking in the search results for the query “solar energy advantages”.\n\nImagine you have a collection of documents and a user searches for “solar energy advantages”.\n\n*   **Document A** is 300 words long and mentions “solar energy” 4 times and “advantages” 3 times.\n*   **Document B** is 1000 words long and mentions “solar energy” 10 times and “advantages” 1 time.\n\n*   **Term Frequency**: The term “solar energy” appears more times in Document B, but due to term saturation, the additional occurrences don’t contribute as much to its relevance score as the first few mentions.\n*   **Inverse Document Frequency**: If “solar energy” and “advantages” are relatively rare in the overall document set, their appearances in these documents increase the relevance score more significantly.\n*   **Document Length Normalization**: Although Document B is longer, BM25’s length normalization ensures that it’s not unduly penalized simply for having more words. The relevance of the terms is balanced against the length of the document.\n\n#### BM25: Evolution of TF-IDF\n\n*   BM25 is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. It’s part of the probabilistic information retrieval model and is considered an evolution of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) model. Both are used to rank documents based on their relevance to a query, but they differ in how they calculate this relevance.\n\n##### BM25\n\n*   **Term Frequency Component**: Like TF-IDF, BM25 considers the frequency of the query term in a document. However, it adds a saturation point to prevent a term’s frequency from disproportionately influencing the document’s relevance.\n*   **Length Normalization**: BM25 adjusts for the length of the document, penalizing longer documents less harshly than TF-IDF.\n*   **Tuning Parameters**: It includes two parameters, k1k1k1 and bbb, which control term saturation and length normalization, respectively. These can be tuned to suit specific types of documents or queries.\n\n##### TF-IDF\n\n*   **Term Frequency**: TF-IDF measures the frequency of a term in a document. The more times the term appears, the higher the score.\n*   **Inverse Document Frequency**: This component reduces the weight of terms that appear in many documents across the corpus, assuming they are less informative.\n*   **Simpler Model**: TF-IDF is generally simpler than BM25 and doesn’t involve parameters like k1k1k1 or bbb.\n\n##### Example\n\n*   Imagine a search query “chocolate cake recipe” and two documents:\n    \n    *   **Document A**: 100 words, “chocolate cake recipe” appears 10 times.\n    *   **Document B**: 1000 words, “chocolate cake recipe” appears 15 times.\n    \n    **Using TF-IDF**:\n    \n    *   The term frequency for “chocolate cake recipe” would be higher in Document A.\n    *   Document B, being longer, might get a lower relevance score due to less frequency of the term.\n    \n    **Using BM25**:\n    \n    *   The term frequency component would reach a saturation point, meaning after a certain frequency, additional occurrences of “chocolate cake recipe” contribute less to the score.\n    *   Length normalization in BM25 would not penalize Document B as heavily as TF-IDF, considering its length.\n    *   The tuning parameters k1k1k1 and bbb could be adjusted to optimize the balance between term frequency and document length.\n*   In essence, while both models aim to determine the relevance of documents to a query, BM25 offers a more nuanced and adjustable approach, especially beneficial in handling longer documents and ensuring that term frequency doesn’t disproportionately affect relevance.\n    \n\nImagine a search query “chocolate cake recipe” and two documents:\n\n*   **Document A**: 100 words, “chocolate cake recipe” appears 10 times.\n*   **Document B**: 1000 words, “chocolate cake recipe” appears 15 times.\n\n**Using TF-IDF**:\n\n*   The term frequency for “chocolate cake recipe” would be higher in Document A.\n*   Document B, being longer, might get a lower relevance score due to less frequency of the term.\n\n**Using BM25**:\n\n*   The term frequency component would reach a saturation point, meaning after a certain frequency, additional occurrences of “chocolate cake recipe” contribute less to the score.\n*   Length normalization in BM25 would not penalize Document B as heavily as TF-IDF, considering its length.\n*   The tuning parameters k1k1k1 and bbb could be adjusted to optimize the balance between term frequency and document length.\n\nIn essence, while both models aim to determine the relevance of documents to a query, BM25 offers a more nuanced and adjustable approach, especially beneficial in handling longer documents and ensuring that term frequency doesn’t disproportionately affect relevance.\n\n#### Limitations of BM25\n\n*   Understanding the limitations below is crucial when implementing BM25 in a search engine or information retrieval system, as it helps in identifying cases where BM25 might need to be supplemented with other techniques or algorithms for better performance.\n\n##### Parameter Sensitivity\n\n*   BM25 includes parameters like k1k1k1 and bbb, which need to be fine-tuned for optimal performance. This tuning process can be complex and is highly dependent on the specific nature of the document collection and queries. Inappropriate parameter settings can lead to suboptimal results.\n\n##### Non-Handling of Semantic Similarities\n\n*   BM25 primarily relies on exact keyword matching. It does not account for the semantic relationships between words. For instance, it would not recognize “automobile” and “car” as related terms unless explicitly programmed to do so. This limitation makes BM25 less effective in understanding the context or capturing the nuances of language.\n\n##### Ineffectiveness with Short Queries or Documents\n\n*   BM25’s effectiveness can decrease with very short queries or documents, as there are fewer words to analyze, making it harder to distinguish relevant documents from irrelevant ones.\n\n##### Length Normalization Challenges\n\n*   While BM25’s length normalization aims to prevent longer documents from being unfairly penalized, it can sometimes lead to the opposite problem, where shorter documents are unduly favored. The balance is not always perfect, and the effectiveness of the normalization can vary based on the dataset.\n\n##### Query Term Independence\n\n*   BM25 assumes independence between query terms. It doesn’t consider the possibility that the presence of certain terms together might change the relevance of a document compared to the presence of those terms individually.\n\n##### Difficulty with Rare Terms\n\n*   Like TF-IDF, BM25 can struggle with very rare terms. If a term appears in very few documents, its IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) component can become disproportionately high, skewing results.\n\n##### Performance in Specialized Domains\n\n*   In specialized domains with unique linguistic features (like legal, medical, or technical fields), BM25 might require significant customization to perform well. This is because standard parameter settings and term-weighting mechanisms may not align well with the unique characteristics of these specialized texts.\n\n##### Ignoring Document Quality\n\n*   BM25 focuses on term frequency and document length but doesn’t consider other aspects that might indicate document quality, such as authoritativeness, readability, or the freshness of information.\n\n##### Vulnerability to Keyword Stuffing\n\n*   Like many other keyword-based algorithms, BM25 can be susceptible to keyword stuffing, where documents are artificially loaded with keywords to boost relevance.\n\n##### Incompatibility with Complex Queries\n\n*   BM25 is less effective for complex queries, such as those involving natural language questions or multi-faceted information needs. It is designed for keyword-based queries and may not perform well with queries that require understanding of context or intent.",

While these methods are effective for ranking documents or identifying keyword importance, they fail to represent the <strong>contextual and relational meaning</strong> that underpins natural language.</li>\n  <li>The motivation for Word2Vec arises from the limitations of count-based models that fail to capture semantics. By introducing a predictive, context-driven learning mechanism, Word2Vec constructs a <strong>semantic embedding space</strong> where contextual relationships between words are preserved. This makes it a foundational technique for subsequent deep learning models such as <strong>GloVe</strong> by <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/D14-1162/\">Pennington et al.

    "contentMarkdown": "*   Proposed in [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) by Mikolov et al. (2013), the Word2Vec algorithm marked a significant advancement in the field of NLP as a notable example of a word embedding technique.\n*   Word2Vec is renowned for its effectiveness in learning word vectors, which are then used to decode the semantic relationships between words. It utilizes a vector space model to encapsulate words in a manner that captures both semantic and syntactic relationships. This method enables the algorithm to discern similarities and differences between words, as well as to identify analogous relationships, such as the parallel between “Stockholm” and “Sweden” and “Cairo” and “Egypt.”\n*   Word2Vec’s methodology of representing words as vectors in a semantic and syntactic space has profoundly impacted the field of NLP, offering a robust framework for capturing the intricacies of language and its usage.\n\n#### Motivation\n\n*   Word2Vec introduced a fundamental shift in NLP by allowing efficient learning of distributed word representations that capture both **semantic** and **syntactic** relationships.\n*   These embeddings support a wide range of downstream tasks, such as text classification, translation, and recommendation systems, due to their ability to encode meaning in vector space.\n*   Key advantages include:\n    *   The ability to **capture semantic similarity** — words appearing in similar contexts have similar vector representations.\n    *   Support for **vector arithmetic** to reveal analogical relationships (for example, “king - man + woman ≈ queen”).\n    *   Computational **efficiency** due to simplified training strategies such as negative sampling and hierarchical softmax (covered in detail later).\n    *   A **shallow network design**, allowing rapid training even on large corpora.\n    *   Generalization across linguistic tasks by representing words in a continuous vector space rather than as discrete symbols.\n\n*   The ability to **capture semantic similarity** — words appearing in similar contexts have similar vector representations.\n*   Support for **vector arithmetic** to reveal analogical relationships (for example, “king - man + woman ≈ queen”).\n*   Computational **efficiency** due to simplified training strategies such as negative sampling and hierarchical softmax (covered in detail later).\n*   A **shallow network design**, allowing rapid training even on large corpora.\n*   Generalization across linguistic tasks by representing words in a continuous vector space rather than as discrete symbols.\n\n#### Theoretical Foundation: Distributional Hypothesis\n\n*   At the heart of Word2Vec lies the **distributional hypothesis** in linguistics, which states that _“words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.”_ Formally, this implies that the meaning of a word www can be inferred from the statistical distribution of other words that co-occur with it in text.\n    \n*   If C(w)C(w)C(w) denotes the set of context words appearing around www within a fixed window, Word2Vec seeks to learn an embedding function f:w↦vw∈ℝNf:w↦vw∈RNf: w \\\\mapsto v\\_w \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^N that maximizes the likelihood of observing those context words.\n    \n*   Thus, for every word wtwtw\\_t in the corpus, the training objective is to maximize:\n    \n    1T∑t\\=1T∑−c≤j≤c,j≠0logp(wt+j|wt)1T∑t\\=1T∑−c≤j≤c,j≠0log⁡p(wt+j|wt)\n    \n    \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\sum\\_{t=1}^{T} \\\\sum\\_{-c \\\\le j \\\\le c, j \\\\ne 0} \\\\log p(w\\_{t+j} | w\\_t)\n    *   where ccc is the context window size and TTT is the corpus length.\n\nAt the heart of Word2Vec lies the **distributional hypothesis** in linguistics, which states that _“words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.”_ Formally, this implies that the meaning of a word www can be inferred from the statistical distribution of other words that co-occur with it in text.\n\nIf C(w)C(w)C(w) denotes the set of context words appearing around www within a fixed window, Word2Vec seeks to learn an embedding function f:w↦vw∈ℝNf:w↦vw∈RNf: w \\\\mapsto v\\_w \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^N that maximizes the likelihood of observing those context words.\n\nThus, for every word wtwtw\\_t in the corpus, the training objective is to maximize:\n\n*   where ccc is the context window size and TTT is the corpus length.\n\n#### Representational Power and Semantic Arithmetic\n\n*   One of the key insights from Word2Vec is that semantic relationships between words can be captured through _linear relationships in vector space_. This means that algebraic operations on word vectors can reveal linguistic regularities, such as:\n\nvking−vman+vwoman≈vqueenvking−vman+vwoman≈vqueen\n\n*   These relationships emerge naturally because Word2Vec embeds words in such a way that **cosine similarity** corresponds to semantic relatedness:\n\nsimilarity(wi,wj)\\=cos(θ)\\=vwi⋅vwj|vwi||vwj|similarity(wi,wj)\\=cos⁡(θ)\\=vwi⋅vwj|vwi||vwj|\n\n*   This property allows for analogical reasoning, clustering, and downstream use in a wide range of NLP tasks.\n\n#### Probabilistic Interpretation\n\n*   From a probabilistic standpoint, Word2Vec models the conditional distribution of context words given a target word (Skip-gram) or a target word given its context (CBOW). The softmax function formalizes this as:\n    \n    p(wo|wi)\\=exp(uTwovwi)∑w′∈Vexp(uTw′vwi)p(wo|wi)\\=exp⁡(uwoTvwi)∑w′∈Vexp⁡(uw′Tvwi)\n    \n    p(w\\_o | w\\_i) = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(u\\_{w\\_o}^T v\\_{w\\_i})}{\\\\sum\\_{w' \\\\in V} \\\\exp(u\\_{w'}^T v\\_{w\\_i})}\n    *   where\n        \n        *   vwivwiv\\_{w\\_i} is the input vector (representing the center or target word),\n        *   uwouwou\\_{w\\_o} is the output vector (representing the context word), and\n        *   VVV is the vocabulary.\n*   This formulation defines a differentiable objective that allows embeddings to be learned through backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.\n    \n*   The following figure shows a simplified visualization of the training process using context prediction.\n    \n\nFrom a probabilistic standpoint, Word2Vec models the conditional distribution of context words given a target word (Skip-gram) or a target word given its context (CBOW). The softmax function formalizes this as:\n\n*   where\n    \n    *   vwivwiv\\_{w\\_i} is the input vector (representing the center or target word),\n    *   uwouwou\\_{w\\_o} is the output vector (representing the context word), and\n    *   VVV is the vocabulary.\n\nwhere\n\n*   vwivwiv\\_{w\\_i} is the input vector (representing the center or target word),\n*   uwouwou\\_{w\\_o} is the output vector (representing the context word), and\n*   VVV is the vocabulary.\n\nThis formulation defines a differentiable objective that allows embeddings to be learned through backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.\n\nThe following figure shows a simplified visualization of the training process using context prediction.\n\n![Word2Vec Training](/primers/ai/assets/intro/14.jpg)\n\n#### Motivation Behind Word2Vec: the Need for Context-based Semantic Understanding\n\n*   Traditional approaches to textual representation—such as **TF-IDF** and **BM25**—treat words as independent entities and rely on counting-based statistics rather than semantic relationships. While these methods are effective for ranking documents or identifying keyword importance, they fail to represent the **contextual and relational meaning** that underpins natural language.\n*   The motivation for Word2Vec arises from the limitations of count-based models that fail to capture semantics. By introducing a predictive, context-driven learning mechanism, Word2Vec constructs a **semantic embedding space** where contextual relationships between words are preserved. This makes it a foundational technique for subsequent deep learning models such as **GloVe** by [Pennington et al. (2014)](https://aclanthology.org/D14-1162/), **fastText** by [Bojanowski et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606), **ELMo** by [Peters et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365), and **BERT** by [Devlin et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), which further refine contextual understanding at the sentence and discourse level.\n\n##### Background: Limitations of Frequency-based Representations\n\n1.  **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**:\n    \n    *   This method assigns weights to terms based on how frequently they appear in a document and how rare they are across a corpus.\n        \n    *   Mathematically, the weight for a term ttt in a document ddd is given by:\n        \n        TF-IDF(t,d)\\=TF(t,d)×logNDF(t)TF-IDF(t,d)\\=TF(t,d)×log⁡NDF(t)\n        \n        \\\\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \\\\text{TF}(t, d) \\\\times \\\\log\\\\frac{N}{\\\\text{DF}(t)}\n        *   where TF(t,d)TF(t,d)\\\\text{TF}(t, d) is the frequency of term ttt in document ddd, DF(t)DF(t)\\\\text{DF}(t) is the number of documents containing ttt, and NNN is the total number of documents.\n    *   While TF-IDF captures **word importance**, it ignores **semantic similarity**—two words like “doctor” and “physician” are treated as entirely distinct, even though they share similar meanings.\n        \n2.  **BM25 (Best Matching 25)**:\n    \n    *   BM25 is a probabilistic ranking function often used in information retrieval, first described by [Robertson & Walker (1994)](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbrp622/papers/foundations_bm25_review.pdf).

It shows how the formula rewards documents containing more query word repetitions (up to a saturation point) while discounting overly common terms. The right-hand logarithmic component reduces the weight of frequent words, while the normalization term adjusts for document length.

The embeddings for these contexts push the representation of _bat_ toward two distinct regions of the semantic space—one near animals, the other near sports equipment.\n\n#### Core Idea\n\n*   Word2Vec represents a transformative shift in natural language understanding by **learning word meanings through prediction tasks** rather than through counting word co-occurrences.\n*   At its core, the algorithm employs a **shallow neural network** trained on a large corpus to predict contextual relationships between words, producing dense, meaningful vector representations that encode both **syntactic** and **semantic** regularities.\n*   The **core idea** behind Word2Vec is to transform linguistic co-occurrence information into a geometric form that captures word meaning through spatial relationships. It does this not by memorizing frequencies, but by **predicting contexts**, allowing the embedding space to inherently encode semantic similarity, analogy, and syntactic relationships in a mathematically continuous manner.\n\n##### Predictive Nature of Word2Vec\n\n*   Unlike earlier statistical methods that rely on co-occurrence counts (e.g., **Latent Semantic Analysis** by [Deerwester et al. (1990)](https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1532-2882.1990.tb00283.x)), Word2Vec learns embeddings by solving a **prediction problem**:\n    \n    *   Given a **target word**, predict its **context words** (Skip-gram).\n    *   Given a set of **context words**, predict the **target word** (CBOW).\n*   This approach stems from the **distributional hypothesis**, operationalized via probabilistic modeling.\n    \n*   Formally, for a corpus with words w1,w2,…,wTw1,w2,…,wTw\\_1, w\\_2, \\\\dots, w\\_T, and context window size ccc, the model maximizes the following average log probability:\n    \n\nUnlike earlier statistical methods that rely on co-occurrence counts (e.g., **Latent Semantic Analysis** by [Deerwester et al.

(2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781?utm_source=chatgpt.com).\n*   Consequently, the **cosine similarity** between two word vectors reflects their semantic closeness:\n\ncos(θ)\\=vwi⋅vwj|vwi||vwj|cos⁡(θ)\\=vwi⋅vwj|vwi||vwj|\n\n##### Network Architecture and Operation\n\n*   The figure below illustrates the internal neural network structure of **Word2Vec**, showing both **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)** and **Skip-gram** architectures.\n    \n    1.  **Input layer**: each word in the context window (for CBOW) or the target word (for Skip-gram) is represented as a **one-hot encoded vector**, where only one element corresponding to the word’s index in the vocabulary is 1 and the rest are 0.\n    2.  **Projection (hidden) layer**: a shared weight matrix transforms these sparse one-hot inputs into dense **N-dimensional embeddings**.

Better\n\n*   Skip-gram updates the embeddings of the **center (target) word** for each of its **context words**, meaning that every occurrence of a word — even a rare one — produces multiple training examples. Each (target, context) pair contributes a separate gradient update, allowing the model to refine the embedding of infrequent words through repeated exposure to their surrounding context.\n    \n*   By contrast, **CBOW** treats rare words as **targets** to be predicted from their neighboring words. Because uncommon words appear less frequently as targets, they are updated fewer times and often with noisy or insufficient context, leading to less accurate representations.\n    \n*   In **small datasets or corpora**, this distinction becomes even more critical. With limited training data, rare words might occur only a few times. Skip-gram’s multiple updates per occurrence help compensate for data scarcity by amplifying each word’s learning signal. CBOW, however, struggles in such settings since it relies on aggregating context signals to predict sparse targets — an approach that benefits more from large, diverse corpora.\n    \n*   **Example:**\n    \n    *   In the sentence “The iguana basked on the rock,” the rare word _iguana_ generates multiple Skip-gram training pairs — (iguana →→\\\\rightarrow the), (iguana →→\\\\rightarrow basked), (iguana →→\\\\rightarrow on), (iguana →→\\\\rightarrow rock) — each producing an update to its embedding.\n    *   Under CBOW, _iguana_ would be predicted only once from the context {the, basked, on, rock}, resulting in fewer gradient updates and weaker representation learning, especially in a small corpus.\n\nSkip-gram updates the embeddings of the **center (target) word** for each of its **context words**, meaning that every occurrence of a word — even a rare one — produces multiple training examples.

Each word in the vocabulary is assigned two learnable vectors: one for when it acts as a **target (input)** word and another for when it acts as a **context (output)** word. These vectors are iteratively updated during training to **maximize the probability of observed word–context pairs** (equivalently, to maximize the log-likelihood of correct predictions). In implementation, this is often expressed as minimizing the **negative log-likelihood loss**, which is the inverse of the same objective.\n    \n*   However, training Word2Vec models efficiently is challenging, especially with large vocabulary sizes. [Mikolov et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) introduced key **approximation strategies** — most notably **negative sampling** and **hierarchical softmax** — that make large-scale training computationally feasible while maintaining embedding quality.

the Full Softmax is Computationally Expensive\n\n*   The denominator of the naive softmax function used in CBOW and Skip-gram requires computing the normalization term over **all words in the vocabulary** (VVV): ∑w′∈Vexp(uTw′vwI)∑w′∈Vexp⁡(uw′TvwI)\\\\sum\\_{w' \\\\in V} \\\\exp(u\\_{w'}^T v\\_{w\\_I}).\n*   For a large vocabulary (where ∣V∣∣V∣\\\\mid V \\\\mid can exceed millions, say 10510510^5 to 10710710^7), this becomes computationally intractable because the denominator must be recalculated for every training pair.\n*   To address this, [Mikolov et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) introduced two key approximation methods: **Hierarchical Softmax** and **Negative Sampling**.\n\n##### Hierarchical Softmax\n\n*   Hierarchical Softmax, introduced by [Morin and Bengio (2005)](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/hierarchical_softmax.pdf) and later applied by [Mikolov et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781), is an efficient alternative to the standard softmax layer used in language models.\n\n###### Concept\n\n*   Hierarchical Softmax replaces the flat softmax layer with a **binary tree** structure—typically a **Huffman tree** built using word frequencies. Each **word is represented as a leaf node**, and the model computes the probability of a word by traversing the path from the root to the corresponding leaf.\n    \n*   The probability of selecting a word is modeled as the **product of probabilities of binary decisions** made at each internal node along this path. This significantly reduces computational cost, especially in settings with very large vocabularies.\n    \n\nHierarchical Softmax replaces the flat softmax layer with a **binary tree** structure—typically a **Huffman tree** built using word frequencies.

This significantly reduces computational cost, especially in settings with very large vocabularies.\n\n###### Loss Function\n\n*   Recall that each word in Word2Vec has two representations: an input vector vwvwv\\_w for when it serves as the target (center) word, and an output vector uwuwu\\_w for when it appears as a context word.\n*   For a given target word www and its input vector vwtvwtv\\_{w\\_t}, let the path from the root of the Huffman tree to www pass through internal nodes n1,n2,…,nLn1,n2,…,nLn\\_1, n\\_2, \\\\dots, n\\_L.\n    \n    *   At each internal node ninin\\_i, a binary decision di∈0,1di∈0,1d\\_i \\\\in {0,1} determines whether to move left (0) or right (1). The conditional probability of word www given the target wtwtw\\_t is:\n    \n    p(w∣wt)\\=∏i\\=1Lσ((1−di)(−uTnivwt)+di(uTnivwt))p(w∣wt)\\=∏i\\=1Lσ((1−di)(−uniTvwt)+di(uniTvwt))\n    \n    p(w \\\\mid w\\_t) = \\\\prod\\_{i=1}^{L} \\\\sigma \\\\left( (1 - d\\_i)(-u\\_{n\\_i}^T v\\_{w\\_t}) + d\\_i(u\\_{n\\_i}^T v\\_{w\\_t}) \\\\right)\n*   Alternatively, using node-indexed notation:\n    \n    p(w∣wi)\\=∏j\\=1L(w)−1σ(dir(n(w,j+1))⋅uTn(w,j)vwi)p(w∣wi)\\=∏j\\=1L(w)−1σ(dir(n(w,j+1))⋅un(w,j)Tvwi)\n    \n    p(w \\\\mid w\\_i) = \\\\prod\\_{j=1}^{L(w)-1} \\\\sigma \\\\left( \\\\text{dir}(n(w,j+1)) \\\\cdot u\\_{n(w,j)}^T v\\_{w\\_i} \\\\right)\n*   where:\n    \n    *   vwtvwtv\\_{w\\_t}: input vector of the target word.\n    *   uniuniu\\_{n\\_i}: output vector of internal node ninin\\_i.\n    *   L(w)L(w)L(w): path length from the root to word www.\n    *   didid\\_i: binary decision at node ninin\\_i (0 = left, 1 = right).\n    *   n(w,j)n(w,j)n(w,j): jthjthj^{th} node along the path to www.\n    *   σ(x)\\=11+e−xσ(x)\\=11+e−x\\\\sigma(x) = \\\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}: sigmoid function mapping scores to probabilities.\n*   This loss function expresses the probability of reaching a leaf node (the target word) in the hierarchical softmax tree by multiplying the sigmoid probabilities of each binary decision along the path. The training objective maximizes this probability — equivalently, the **log-likelihood of the correct word given its context**.\n\n*   At each internal node ninin\\_i, a binary decision di∈0,1di∈0,1d\\_i \\\\in {0,1} determines whether to move left (0) or right (1).

(2013) in their [second Word2Vec paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf), is an efficient alternative to softmax for training word embeddings. It reframes the prediction task as a **binary classification** problem, allowing the model to focus on distinguishing real word-context pairs from artificially generated ones.\n\n###### Concept\n\n*   Instead of computing probabilities across the entire vocabulary (as in softmax), **Negative Sampling** reframes training as a binary classification task: the model learns to distinguish **genuine word-context pairs (positive samples)** from **randomly generated pairs (negative samples)**.\n    \n*   For each true pair of words (wi,wo)(wi,wo)(w\\_i, w\\_o): where wiwiw\\_i is the _input (target)_ word and wowow\\_o is the _output (context)_ word — the model samples KKK negative words w′1,w′2,…,w′Kw1′,w2′,…,wK′w\\_1', w\\_2', \\\\ldots, w\\_K' from a **noise distribution** (commonly proportional to word frequency raised to the power of 3434\\\\tfrac{3}{4}).\n    \n*   During each training step, the model updates only a **small subset of embeddings**:\n    \n    1.  The **input vector** vwivwiv\\_{w\\_i} of the current target word, since it is directly involved in all dot products for that step.\n    2.  The **output vector** uwouwou\\_{w\\_o} of the positive (true) context word, which is reinforced to align more closely with vwivwiv\\_{w\\_i}.\n    3.  The **output vectors** uw′1,…,uw′Kuw1′,…,uwK′u\\_{w\\_1'}, \\\\ldots, u\\_{w\\_K'} of the sampled negative words, which are adjusted in the opposite direction to reduce similarity with vwivwiv\\_{w\\_i}.\n*   All other words in the vocabulary remain untouched during that iteration. This **sparse parameter update** is what makes negative sampling dramatically more efficient than the full softmax computation, which would otherwise require updating every output vector in the vocabulary.\n    \n\nInstead of computing probabilities across the entire vocabulary (as in softmax), **Negative Sampling** reframes training as a binary classification task: the model learns to distinguish **genuine word-context pairs (positive samples)** from **randomly generated pairs (negative samples)**.\n\nFor each true pair of words (wi,wo)(wi,wo)(w\\_i, w\\_o): where wiwiw\\_i is the _input (target)_ word and wowow\\_o is the _output (context)_ word — the model samples KKK negative words w′1,w′2,…,w′Kw1′,w2′,…,wK′w\\_1', w\\_2', \\\\ldots, w\\_K' from a **noise distribution** (commonly proportional to word frequency raised to the power of 3434\\\\tfrac{3}{4}).\n\nDuring each training step, the model updates only a **small subset of embeddings**:\n\n1.

have **lower dot products**, pushing their embeddings apart.\n*   This leads to embeddings where **semantically similar words are close together**, while dissimilar ones are far apart.\n\n###### Advantages\n\n*   Extremely **efficient**—updates are limited to a small subset of the vocabulary.\n*   Requires only **5–20 negative samples** per step to perform well.\n*   Empirically matches or exceeds the performance of Hierarchical Softmax in many NLP tasks.\n*   Highly **parallelizable**, making it well-suited for GPU acceleration.\n\n###### Disadvantages\n\n*   Does **not model a full probability distribution** over the vocabulary.\n*   Primarily useful for **embedding learning**, not for tasks requiring normalized probabilities.\n\n##### Subsampling of Frequent Words\n\n*   High-frequency words such as “the,” “of,” and “and” appear so often that they dominate the training process without adding semantic value.\n*   To address this, Mikolov et al. proposed randomly discarding frequent words with probability:\n    \n    P(wi)\\=1−tf(wi)‾‾‾‾‾‾√P(wi)\\=1−tf(wi)\n    \n    P(w\\_i) = 1 - \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{t}{f(w\\_i)}}\n    *   where ttt is a threshold typically 10−510−510^{-5}, and f(wi)f(wi)f(w\\_i) is the relative frequency of word wiwiw\\_i.\n*   This reduces training time and improves vector quality for less frequent words.\n\nTo address this, Mikolov et

wiwiw\\_i.\n\n##### Related: Parallelization and Efficiency\n\n*   While not an “optimization” technique per se, Word2Vec’s architecture is ideal for parallelization.\n    *   Each word–context pair can be processed independently.\n    *   Distributed implementations (such as in **Gensim** and **TensorFlow**) leverage multi-core and GPU computation.\n*   Training large models (e.g., Google News corpus with 100 billion words) typically converges within hours on standard hardware.\n\n*   Each word–context pair can be processed independently.\n*   Distributed implementations (such as in

encode **semantic** and **syntactic** information in a **continuous, semantically meaningful geometric space**.\n    \n    *   Proximity represents similarity of meaning.\n    *   Direction represents relational structure.\n    *   Linear operations capture analogies and transformations.\n*   This property makes Word2Vec a cornerstone in modern NLP — providing not only compact word representations but also interpretable relationships that reflect the way humans understand language.\n*   These embeddings are powerful because they convert discrete linguistic units (words) into numerical representations that reflect **meaning**, **contextual similarity**, and **linguistic regularities**.\n\nWord2Vec’s training process produces a set of word vectors (embeddings) that encode **semantic** and **syntactic** information in a **continuous, semantically meaningful geometric space**.\n\n*   Proximity represents similarity of meaning.\n*   Direction represents relational structure.\n*   Linear operations capture analogies and transformations.\n\n##### From Co-occurrence to Geometry\n\n*   During training, Word2Vec positions each word vector vw∈ℝNvw∈RNv\\_w \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^N such that words occurring in similar contexts are **close to each other** in the embedding space.\n    \n*   Mathematically, if two words wiwiw\\_i and wjwjw\\_j share similar context distributions, their conditional probabilities p(C∣wi)p(C∣wi)p(C \\\\mid w\\_i) and p(C∣wj)p(C∣wj)p(C \\\\mid w\\_j) are alike, leading to embeddings with high **cosine similarity**:\n    \n\nDuring

w\\_j) are alike, leading to embeddings with high **cosine similarity**:\n\nsimilarity(wi,wj)\\=cos(θ)\\=vwi⋅vwj|vwi||vwj|similarity(wi,wj)\\=cos⁡(θ)\\=vwi⋅vwj|vwi||vwj|\n\n*   This means that words like _dog_ and _cat_, which appear in similar linguistic environments (e.g., near words like _pet_, _animal_, _food_), will have vectors oriented in similar directions.\n\n##### Linear Relationships and Analogy\n\n*   One of the most celebrated properties of Word2Vec embeddings is their ability to capture **analogical relationships** using simple linear algebra.\n*   These relationships emerge naturally from the model’s predictive training objective, which enforces consistent geometric offsets between semantically related words.\n    \n*   For instance:\n\nThese relationships emerge naturally from the model’s predictive training objective, which enforces consistent geometric offsets between semantically related words.\n\nvking−vman+vwoman≈vqueenvking−vman+vwoman≈vqueen\n\n*   This implies that **the relationship between “man” and “woman”** is encoded as a **directional vector offset** in the space, and the same offset applies to other analogous pairs like:\n\nvParis−vFrance+vItaly≈vRomevParis−vFrance+vItaly≈vRome\n\n##### Clustering and Semantic Neighborhoods\n\n*   When visualized (e.g., using t-SNE or PCA), Word2Vec embeddings form **clusters** that group together semantically or syntactically similar words.\n    \n    *   **Semantic clusters**: Words such as _dog_, _cat_, _horse_, _cow_ cluster under the broader concept of _animals_.\n    *   **Syntactic clusters**: Words like _running_, _swimming_, _jumping_ cluster based on grammatical function (verbs in gerund form).\n*   In this space, **semantic similarity** corresponds to **spatial proximity**, and **semantic relations** correspond to **vector directions**.\n    \n\nWhen visualized (e.g., using t-SNE or PCA), Word2Vec embeddings form **clusters** that group together semantically

relations** correspond to **vector directions**.\n\n##### Interpreting the Embedding Space\n\n*   The embedding space captures multiple types of relationships:\n\n**Relationship Type**\n\n**Example**\n\n**Geometric Interpretation**\n\nSynonymy\n\n_happy_ ↔ _joyful_\n\nSmall cosine distance\n\nAntonymy\n\n_good_ ↔ _bad_\n\nLarge angle, opposite directions\n\nHierarchical\n\n_car_ ↔ _vehicle_\n\n“Parent–child” proximity\n\nAnalogical\n\n_king – man + woman ≈ queen_\n\nConsistent vector offset\n\n**Relationship

directions\n\nHierarchical\n\n_car_ ↔ _vehicle_\n\n“Parent–child” proximity\n\nAnalogical\n\n_king – man + woman ≈ queen_\n\nConsistent vector offset\n\n*   This geometric consistency arises because the **dot product** uTwovwiuwoTvwiu\\_{w\\_o}^T v\\_{w\\_i}: central to Word2Vec’s loss function — forces the space to preserve _relational proportionality_ among co-occurring words. For more theoretical grounding on this, see [Levy and Goldberg (2014)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5477-neural-word-embedding-as-implicit-matrix-factorization.pdf).\n\n##### Example: Semantic Continuity\n\n*   To illustrate, consider these relationships in trained embeddings:\n    \n    vFrance−vParis≈vItaly−vRomevFrance−vParis≈vItaly−vRome\n    \n    v\\_{\\\\text{France}} - v\\_{\\\\text{Paris}} \\\\approx v\\_{\\\\text{Italy}} - v\\_{\\\\text{Rome}}\n    \n    vwalking−vwalk≈vrunning−vrunvwalking−vwalk≈vrunning−vrun\n    \n    v\\_{\\\\text{walking}} - v\\_{\\\\text{walk}} \\\\approx v\\_{\\\\text{running}} - v\\_{\\\\text{run}}\n*   Both examples demonstrate that **semantic and syntactic transformations** (capital–country or verb–tense) are encoded as **parallel vectors** in the embedding space.\n    \n\nTo illustrate, consider these relationships in trained embeddings:\n\nBoth examples demonstrate that **semantic and syntactic transformations** (capital–country or verb–tense) are encoded as **parallel vectors** in the embedding space.\n\n#### Distinction from Traditional Models\n\n*   Word2Vec represents a fundamental paradigm shift from earlier **count-based** and **probabilistic** language models.\n*   Traditional methods typically relied on explicit frequency counts or co-occurrence matrices, while Word2Vec learns **distributed representations** that are continuous, dense, and semantically meaningful.

By representing words as continuous vectors in a semantic space, it enabled machines to understand words not merely as symbolic tokens, but as entities with inherent relationships and structure.\n    \n*   However, despite its groundbreaking impact, Word2Vec’s design introduces several inherent **limitations** that eventually spurred the development of more advanced **contextualized embedding models**. These limitations stem primarily from its **static and context-independent nature**—each word is assigned a single vector, regardless of its varying meanings in different contexts. Additionally, Word2Vec’s approach to processing context and dealing with data sparsity posed further challenges in capturing nuanced language use.\n    \n*   To address these shortcomings, newer models emerged that not only capture the general meaning of words but also adapt dynamically to their **context** within a sentence or document.

_“bank”_ is assigned a single vector whether it refers to a _financial institution_ or the _side of a river_.\n    *   As a result, multiple senses of a word (polysemy) are **collapsed into a single

vw\\=f(w)vw\\=f(w)v\\_w = f(w), independent of its local context.\n    *   This static representation means that semantic disambiguation is impossible within the model itself.\n*   **Combination of Contexts**:\n    \n    *   Because all usages of a word are averaged during training, the resulting embedding represents an **aggregate of multiple meanings**.\n    *   For example, “apple” in “Apple released a new iPhone” (corporate sense) and “I ate an apple” (fruit sense) are both used to update the same embedding vector.\n    *   The consequence is a **semantic compromise** — embeddings become blurry averages of distinct meanings.\n*   **Lack of Contextual Adaptation**:\n    \n    *   Word2Vec’s fixed-size context window only captures **local co-occurrence statistics**, not long-range dependencies or sentence-level structure.\n    *   Thus, the model cannot adapt a word’s meaning dynamically based on its syntactic role or broader discourse context.\n        \n    *   Example:\n        *   “She read a _book_.”\n        *   “He will _book_ a flight.” Word2Vec assigns nearly identical vectors to “book” in both cases, even though one is a **noun** and the other a **verb**.\n\n**Single Vector per Word**:\n\n*   In Word2Vec, each word type is represented by **one fixed embedding**, regardless of the sentence or context in which it appears.\n*   For instance, the word _“bank”_ is assigned a single vector whether it refers to a _financial institution_ or the _side of a river_.\n*   As a result, multiple senses of a word (polysemy) are **collapsed into a single point** in the embedding space.\n    \n*   Mathematically, for all occurrences of a word www, Word2Vec assigns one embedding vw∈ℝNvw∈RNv\\_w \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^N, such that vw\\=f(w)vw\\=f(w)v\\_w =

Considerations\n\n*   **Training Adjustments**:\n    \n    *   Throughout training, Word2Vec adjusts embeddings through stochastic gradient descent to improve co-occurrence prediction accuracy.\n    *   However, these updates are purely statistical — not semantic — meaning the model refines embeddings globally rather than creating distinct sense representations.\n*   **Computational Demands**:\n    \n    *   Although optimized via negative sampling, training large vocabularies (millions of words) still requires significant computational resources and memory.\n    *   Furthermore, retraining or updating embeddings for new corpora often demands complete reinitialization, since Word2Vec lacks an efficient fine-tuning mechanism.\n\n**Training Adjustments**:\n\n*   Throughout training, Word2Vec

are **non-compositional**.\n    *   For instance, “hot potato” or “New York Times” cannot be represented by simply averaging the vectors of their component words.\n    *   As proposed by [Mikolov et al. (2013)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf), one partial solution was to treat frequent phrases as single tokens using statistical co-occurrence detection.\n*   **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words**:\n    \n    *   Word2Vec cannot generate embeddings for words not seen during training.\n    *   This limitation is particularly problematic for morphologically rich or non-segmented languages.\n    *   Later models such as **FastText** addressed this by representing words as compositions of character n-grams, allowing generalization to unseen forms.\n\n**Phrase and Idiom Representation**:\n\n*   Word2Vec struggles with multi-word expressions or idioms whose meanings are **non-compositional**.\n*   For instance, “hot potato” or “New York Times” cannot be represented by simply averaging the vectors of their component words.\n*   As proposed by [Mikolov et al.

(2014)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P14-1146) proposed **Sentiment-Specific Word Embeddings (SSWE)**, which integrate polarity supervision into the loss function to separate words by sentiment.\n\n**Uniform Representation Across Contexts**:\n\n*   Word2Vec, like GloVe, produces a **global vector** for each word.\n*   This uniformity neglects that a word’s meaning shifts with context.\n*   For example, the embeddings for _“light”_ cannot distinguish between “light weight” and “light bulb.”\n\n**Sentiment Polarity and Context Sensitivity**:\n\n*   Because Word2Vec relies on unsupervised co-occurrence statistics, it can place antonyms such as _“good”_ and _“bad”_ near each other if they occur in similar syntactic positions.\n*   This leads to issues in sentiment analysis tasks, where distinguishing polarity is essential.\n*   [Tang et al.

This trade-off — efficiency and generality versus contextual precision — defined the next phase of NLP research.\n\n##### Advances Beyond Word2Vec\n\n*   To overcome these challenges, newer models introduced **contextualized embeddings**, where a word’s representation dynamically changes depending on its sentence-level context.\n    \n    1.  **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word

surrounding sentence, allowing dynamic sense representation.\n    4.  **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**:\n        \n        *   Leverages the Transformer architecture to model **bidirectional context** simultaneously.\n        *   Each occurrence of a word is encoded uniquely as a function of the entire sequence, capturing fine-grained semantics, syntax, and disambiguation.\n        *   Formally, embeddings are contextualized as:\n            \n            vwi\\=f(wi,w1:T)vwi\\=f(wi,w1:T)\n            \n            v\\_{w\\_i} = f(w\\_i, w\\_{1:T})\n

 Word2Vec introduced practical strategies that allowed large-scale training long before transformer-based systems existed.\n    \n    1.  **Softmax Approximation Challenge**\n        \n        *   Computing the denominator in the softmax function:\n        \n        p(wo|wi)\\=exp(uTwovwi)∑w′∈Vexp(uTw′vwi)p(wo|wi)\\=exp⁡(uwoTvwi)∑w′∈Vexp⁡(uw′Tvwi)\n        \n        p(w\\_o | w\\_i) = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(u\\_{w\\_o}^T v\\_{w\\_i})}{\\\\sum\\_{w' \\\\in V} \\\\exp(u\\_{w'}^T v\\_{w\\_i})}\n        *   required summing over the entire vocabulary, which is computationally infeasible for large corpora.\n    2.  **Negative Sampling Solution**\n        \n        *   Word2Vec replaced the full softmax with **negative sampling**, reframing prediction as a binary classification task:\n        \n        NS\\=−logσ(uTwovwi)−∑k\\=1Klogσ(−uTwkvwi)LNS\\=−log⁡σ(uwoTvwi)−∑k\\=1Klog⁡σ(−uwkTvwi)\n        \n        \\\\mathcal{L}\\_{NS} = -\\\\log \\\\sigma(u\\_{w\\_o}^T v\\_{w\\_i}) - \\\\sum\\_{k=1}^{K} \\\\log \\\\sigma(-u\\_{w\\_k}^T v\\_{w\\_i})\n        *   Here, positive word pairs are pulled closer in vector space, and random negative pairs are pushed apart — allowing efficient updates with only a few sampled words per step.\n    3.  **Hierarchical Softmax**\n        *   An alternate efficiency method that organizes the vocabulary as a Huffman tree, reducing computational complexity from O(∣V∣)O(∣V∣)O(\\\\mid V \\\\mid) to O(log∣V∣)O(log∣V∣)O(\\\\log \\\\mid V \\\\mid).\n*   These innovations enabled Word2Vec to scale to billions of tokens — laying the

(2014), Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) embeddings are a type of word representation used in NLP. They are designed to capture not just the local context of words but also their global co-occurrence statistics in a corpus, thus providing a rich and nuanced word representation.</li>\n  <li>By blending these approaches, GloVe captures a fuller picture of word meaning and usage, making it a valuable tool for various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval.</li>\n  <li>Here’s a detailed explanation along with an example:</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"how-glove-works\">How GloVe Works</h4>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Co-Occurrence Matrix:</strong> GloVe starts by constructing a large matrix that represents the co-occurrence statistics of words in a given corpus.

    "contentMarkdown": "#### Overview\n\n*   Proposed in [GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation](https://aclanthology.org/D14-1162) by Pennington et al. (2014), Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) embeddings are a type of word representation used in NLP. They are designed to capture not just the local context of words but also their global co-occurrence statistics in a corpus, thus providing a rich and nuanced word representation.\n*   By blending these approaches, GloVe captures a fuller picture of word meaning and usage, making it a valuable tool for various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval.\n*   Here’s a detailed explanation along with an example:\n\n#### How GloVe Works\n\n1.  **Co-Occurrence Matrix:** GloVe starts by constructing a large matrix that represents the co-occurrence statistics of words in a given corpus. This matrix has dimensions of `[vocabulary size] x [vocabulary size]`, where each entry (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) in the matrix represents how often word i occurs in the context of word j.\n    \n2.  **Matrix Factorization:** The algorithm then applies matrix factorization techniques to this co-occurrence matrix. The goal is to reduce the dimensions of each word into a lower-dimensional space (the embedding space), while preserving the co-occurrence information.\n    \n3.  **Word Vectors:** The end result is that each word in the corpus is represented by a vector in this embedding space. Words with similar meanings or that often appear in similar contexts will have similar vectors.\n    \n4.  **Relationships and Analogies:** These vectors capture complex patterns and relationships between words. For example, they can capture analogies like “man is to king as woman is to queen” by showing that the vector ‘king’ - ‘man’ + ‘woman’ is close to ‘queen’.\n    \n\n**Co-Occurrence Matrix:** GloVe starts by constructing a large matrix that represents the co-occurrence statistics of words in a given corpus. This matrix has dimensions of `[vocabulary size] x [vocabulary size]`, where each entry (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) in the matrix represents how often word i occurs in the context of word j.\n\n**Matrix Factorization:** The algorithm then applies matrix factorization techniques to this co-occurrence matrix. The goal is to reduce the dimensions of each word into a lower-dimensional space (the embedding space), while preserving the co-occurrence information.\n\n**Word Vectors:** The end result is that each word in the corpus is represented by a vector in this embedding space. Words with similar meanings or that often appear in similar contexts will have similar vectors.\n\n**Relationships and Analogies:** These vectors capture complex patterns and relationships between words. For example, they can capture analogies like “man is to king as woman is to queen” by showing that the vector ‘king’ - ‘man’ + ‘woman’ is close to ‘queen’.\n\n#### Example\n\n*   Imagine a simple corpus with the following sentences:\n    *   “The cat sat on the mat.”\n    *   “The dog sat on the log.”\n*   From this corpus, a co-occurrence matrix is constructed. For instance, ‘cat’ and ‘mat’ will have a higher co-occurrence score because they appear close to each other in the sentences. Similarly, ‘dog’ and ‘log’ will be close in the embedding space.\n*   After applying GloVe, each word (like ‘cat’, ‘dog’, ‘mat’, ‘log’) will be represented as a vector. The vector representation captures the essence of each word, not just based on the context within its immediate sentence, but also based on how these words co-occur in the entire corpus.\n*   In a large and diverse corpus, GloVe can capture complex relationships. For example, it might learn that ‘cat’ and ‘dog’ are both pets, and this will be reflected in how their vectors are positioned relative to each other and to other words like ‘pet’, ‘animal’, etc.\n\n*   “The cat sat on the mat.”\n*   “The dog sat on the log.”\n\n#### Significance of GloVe\n\n*   GloVe is powerful because it combines the benefits of two major approaches in word representation:\n    *   **Local Context Window Methods (like Word2Vec):** These methods look at the local context, but might miss the broader context of word usage across the entire corpus.\n    *   **Global Matrix Factorization Methods:** These methods, like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), consider global word co-occurrence but might miss the nuances of local word usage.\n\n*   **Local Context Window Methods (like Word2Vec):** These methods look at the local context, but might miss the broader context of word usage across the entire corpus.\n*   **Global Matrix Factorization Methods:** These methods, like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), consider global word co-occurrence but might miss the nuances of local word usage.\n\n#### Limitations of GloVe\n\n*   While GloVe has been widely used and offers several rich word representations, it may not be the optimal choice for every NLP application, especially those requiring context sensitivity, handling of rare words, or efficient handling of computational resources as detailed below.\n\n##### Lack of Context-Sensitivity\n\n*   **Issue:** GloVe generates a single, static vector for each word, regardless of the specific context in which the word is used. This can be a significant limitation, especially for words with multiple meanings (polysemy).\n*   **Example:** The word “bank” will have the same vector representation whether it refers to the side of a river or a financial institution, potentially leading to confusion in downstream tasks where context matters.\n*   **Comparison:** Modern models like BERT and GPT address this limitation by creating context-sensitive embeddings, where the meaning of a word can change based on the sentence or context in which it appears.\n\n##### Inefficient for Rare Words\n\n*   **Issue:** GloVe relies on word co-occurrence statistics from large corpora, which means it may not generate meaningful vectors for rare words or words that don’t appear frequently enough in the training data.\n*   **Example:** Words that occur infrequently in a corpus will have less reliable vector representations, potentially leading to poor performance on tasks that involve rare or domain-specific vocabulary.\n*   **Comparison:** Subword-based models like FastText handle this limitation more effectively by creating word representations based on character n-grams, allowing even rare words to have meaningful embeddings.\n\n##### Corpus Dependence\n\n*   **Issue:** The quality of the GloVe embeddings is highly dependent on the quality and size of the training corpus. If the corpus lacks diversity or is biased, the resulting word vectors will reflect these limitations.\n*   **Example:** A GloVe model trained on a narrow or biased dataset may fail to capture the full range of meanings or relationships between words, especially in domains or languages not well-represented in the corpus.\n*   **Comparison:** This issue is less pronounced in models like transformer-based architectures, where transfer learning allows fine-tuning on specific tasks or domains, reducing the dependence on a single corpus.\n\n##### Computational Cost\n\n*   **Issue:** Training GloVe embeddings on large corpora involves computing and factorizing large co-occurrence matrices, which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive.\n*   **Example:** The memory requirement for storing the full co-occurrence matrix grows quadratically with the size of the vocabulary, which can be prohibitive for very large datasets.\n*   **Comparison:** While Word2Vec also has computational challenges, GloVe’s matrix factorization step tends to be more resource-intensive than the shallow neural networks used by Word2Vec.\n\n##### Limited to Word-Level Representation\n\n*   **Issue:** GloVe embeddings operate at the word level and do not directly handle subword information such as prefixes, suffixes, or character-level nuances.\n*   **Example:** Morphologically rich languages, where words can take many forms based on tense, gender, or plurality, may not be well-represented in GloVe embeddings.\n*   **Comparison:** FastText, in contrast, incorporates subword information into its word vectors, allowing it to better represent words in languages with complex morphology or in cases where a word is rare but its root form is common.\n\n##### Inability to Handle OOV (Out-of-Vocabulary) Words\n\n*   **Issue:** Since GloVe produces fixed embeddings for words during the training phase, it cannot generate embeddings for words that were not present in the training corpus, known as Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) words.\n*   **Example:** If a new or domain-specific word is encountered during testing or inference, GloVe cannot generate a meaningful vector for it.\n*   **Comparison:** Subword-based models like FastText or context-based models like BERT can mitigate this problem by creating embeddings dynamically, even for unseen words.",

In traditional models like Word2Vec, each word is treated as a distinct unit, and if words like “breathtakingly” are rare in the training dataset, the model may not have a meaningful representation for them.</li>\n  <li>With fastText, “breathtakingly” is broken down into subwords (e.g., “breat”, “eathtaking”, “htakingly”, etc.). fastText then learns vectors for these subwords. When computing the vector for “breathtakingly”, it aggregates the vectors of its subwords. This approach allows fastText to handle rare words more effectively, as it can utilize the information from common subwords to understand less common or even out-of-vocabulary words.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"limitations-of-fasttext\">Limitations of FastText</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Despite its many strengths, fastText has several limitations that users should be aware of. These limitations can influence the effectiveness and appropriateness of fastText for certain NLP tasks, and understanding them can help users make more informed decisions when choosing word embedding models.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"limited-contextual-awareness\">Limited Contextual Awareness</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>fastText operates on the principle of learning word embeddings by breaking down words into subwords. However, it does not consider the broader context in which a word appears within a sentence. This is because fastText, like Word2Vec, generates static embeddings, meaning that each word or subword is represented by the same vector regardless of its surrounding context.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>For instance, the word “bank” in the sentences “He went to the bank to withdraw money” and “He sat by the river bank” will have the same embedding, even though the meanings are different in each case.

For instance, in sentences where key information is spread out over several words (e.g., “The man, who was wearing a red jacket, crossed the street”), fastText cannot effectively model relationships between the subject and the predicate when they are far apart. Models like LSTMs or transformers are more suited for handling such dependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"scalability-and-resource-requirements\">Scalability and Resource Requirements</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>While fastText is designed to be efficient, it still requires significant computational resources, especially when dealing with large corpora or many languages.

In addition, the storage requirements for embeddings can grow substantially, particularly when generating embeddings for extensive vocabularies with numerous subwords.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"lack-of-language-specific-optimizations\">Lack of Language-Specific Optimizations</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>Although fastText is well-suited for morphologically rich languages, it lacks the language-specific optimizations that some newer NLP models (like multilingual BERT) offer. fastText treats all languages uniformly, which can be a limitation for languages with unique syntactic or semantic characteristics that require specialized treatment. For example, languages with complex agreement systems or non-concatenative morphology might benefit from more tailored approaches than fastText provides.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"limited-performance-in-highly-context-dependent-tasks\">Limited Performance in Highly Context-Dependent Tasks</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>fastText performs well in tasks where morphology and subword information play a key role, such as text classification or simple sentiment analysis.

It generates embeddings for these words based on their subword units, allowing it to infer some meaning from these subcomponents.\n    \n3.  **Efficiency in Learning Word Representations**: fastText is efficient in learning representations for words that appear infrequently in the corpus, which is a significant limitation in many other word embedding techniques.\n    \n4.  **Applicability to Various Languages**: Its subword feature makes it particularly suitable for languages with rich word formations and complex morphology, like Turkish or Finnish.\n    \n5.  **Word Embedding and Text Classification**: fastText can be used both for generating word embeddings and for text classification purposes, providing versatile applications in NLP tasks.\n    \n\n**Subword Information**: Unlike traditional models that treat words as the smallest unit for training, fastText breaks down words into smaller units - subwords or character n-grams.

In traditional models like Word2Vec, each word is treated as a distinct unit, and if words like “breathtakingly” are rare in the training dataset, the model may not have a meaningful representation for them.\n*   With fastText, “breathtakingly” is broken down into subwords (e.g., “breat”, “eathtaking”, “htakingly”, etc.). fastText then learns vectors for these subwords. When computing the vector for “breathtakingly”, it aggregates the vectors of its subwords. This approach allows fastText to handle rare words more effectively, as it can utilize the information from common subwords to understand less common or even out-of-vocabulary words.\n\n#### Limitations of FastText\n\n*   Despite its many strengths, fastText has several limitations that users should be aware of. These limitations can influence the effectiveness and appropriateness of fastText for certain NLP tasks, and understanding them can help users make more informed decisions when choosing word embedding models.\n\n##### Limited Contextual Awareness\n\n*   fastText operates on the principle of learning word embeddings by breaking down words into subwords. However, it does not consider the broader context in which a word appears within a sentence. This is because fastText, like Word2Vec, generates static embeddings, meaning that each word or subword is represented by the same vector regardless of its surrounding context.\n    \n*   For instance, the word “bank” in the sentences “He went to the bank to withdraw money” and “He sat by the river bank” will have the same embedding, even though the meanings are different in each case. More advanced models like BERT or GPT address this limitation by generating dynamic, context-sensitive embeddings.\n    \n\nfastText operates on the principle of learning word embeddings by breaking down words into subwords.

More advanced models like BERT or GPT address this limitation by generating dynamic, context-sensitive embeddings.\n\n##### Sensitivity to Subword Granularity\n\n*   While fastText’s subword approach is one of its key strengths, it can also be a limitation depending on the language and task. The choice of n-grams (i.e., the length of subwords) can have a significant impact on the quality of embeddings. Selecting the wrong subword granularity may lead to suboptimal performance, as shorter n-grams might capture too much noise, while longer n-grams may fail to generalize effectively.\n    \n*   Furthermore, fastText might overemphasize certain subwords, leading to biases in word embeddings. For example, frequent subword combinations (e.g., prefixes and suffixes) might dominate the representation, overshadowing the contributions of other meaningful subword units.\n    \n\nWhile fastText’s subword approach is one of its key strengths, it can also be a limitation depending on the language and task.

For example, frequent subword combinations (e.g., prefixes and suffixes) might dominate the representation, overshadowing the contributions of other meaningful subword units.\n\n##### Inability to Model Long-Distance Dependencies\n\n*   fastText’s reliance on local subword features means it struggles to capture long-distance dependencies between words in a sentence. For instance, in sentences where key information is spread out over several words (e.g., “The man, who was wearing a red jacket, crossed the street”), fastText cannot effectively model relationships between the subject and the predicate when they are far apart. Models like LSTMs or transformers are more suited for handling such dependencies.\n\n##### Scalability and Resource Requirements\n\n*   While fastText is designed to be efficient, it still requires significant computational resources, especially when dealing with large corpora or many languages. Training models with large n-grams can increase both the memory and time required for training. In addition, the storage requirements for embeddings can grow substantially, particularly when generating embeddings for extensive vocabularies with numerous subwords.\n\n##### Lack of Language-Specific Optimizations\n\n*   Although fastText is well-suited for morphologically rich languages, it lacks the language-specific optimizations that some newer NLP models (like multilingual BERT) offer. fastText treats all languages uniformly, which can be a limitation for languages with unique syntactic or semantic characteristics that require specialized treatment. For example, languages with complex agreement systems or non-concatenative morphology might benefit from more tailored approaches than fastText provides.\n\n##### Limited Performance in Highly Context-Dependent Tasks\n\n*   fastText performs well in tasks where morphology and subword information play a key role, such as text classification or simple sentiment analysis. However, for highly context-dependent tasks such as machine translation, nuanced sentiment detection, or question-answering systems, fastText may not provide enough context sensitivity. More sophisticated models like transformers, which are designed to capture nuanced semantic and syntactic relationships, generally perform better in such scenarios.",

    "contentHtml": "<ul>\n  <li>BoW, TF-IDF, BM25, Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText each have distinct ways of representing words and their meanings. However, all of these methods generate a single embedding per word, leading to a blended representation of different senses for polysemous words. This approach averages the contexts, which can dilute the specific meanings of polysemous words. Put simply, a major challenge across several of these methods is their inability to handle polysemous words (words with multiple meanings) effectively, often resulting in a single representation that blends different senses of the word. While later methods such as fastText provide some improvements by leveraging subword information, none fully resolves the issue of distinguishing between different senses of a word based on its context.</li>\n  <li>BERT, on the other hand, overcomes this limitation by generating contextualized embeddings that adapt to the specific meaning of a word based on its surrounding context.

    "contentMarkdown": "*   BoW, TF-IDF, BM25, Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText each have distinct ways of representing words and their meanings. However, all of these methods generate a single embedding per word, leading to a blended representation of different senses for polysemous words. This approach averages the contexts, which can dilute the specific meanings of polysemous words. Put simply, a major challenge across several of these methods is their inability to handle polysemous words (words with multiple meanings) effectively, often resulting in a single representation that blends different senses of the word. While later methods such as fastText provide some improvements by leveraging subword information, none fully resolves the issue of distinguishing between different senses of a word based on its context.\n*   BERT, on the other hand, overcomes this limitation by generating contextualized embeddings that adapt to the specific meaning of a word based on its surrounding context. This allows BERT to differentiate between multiple senses of a polysemous word, providing a more accurate representation.\n*   Below is a detailed examination of how each method deals with polysemy.\n\n#### Bag of Words (BoW)\n\n*   **Description:**\n    *   BoW is a simple method that represents text as a collection of words without considering grammar or word order. It counts the frequency of each word in a document.\n*   **Handling Polysemy:**\n    *   **Word Frequency:**\n        *   BoW does not create embeddings; instead, it treats each word as an individual token. Therefore, it cannot distinguish between different meanings of a word in different contexts.\n    *   **Context Insensitivity:**\n        *   The method cannot differentiate between polysemous meanings, as each occurrence of a word contributes equally to its frequency count, regardless of its meaning in context.\n    *   **Limitations:**\n        *   Since BoW lacks context sensitivity, polysemous words are treated as if they have only one meaning, which limits its effectiveness in capturing semantic nuances.\n\n*   BoW is a simple method that represents text as a collection of words without considering grammar or word order.

It assigns higher weights to words that appear frequently in a document but less often in the corpus.\n*   **Handling Polysemy:**\n    *   **Term Weighting:**\n        *   TF-IDF improves over BoW by emphasizing less common but important words. However, it still treats each word as a unique token without considering its multiple meanings in different contexts.\n    *   **Context-Agnostic:**\n        *   Like BoW, TF-IDF does not distinguish between the different senses of polysemous words, as it focuses on term frequency without leveraging context.\n    *   **Limitations:**\n        *   While TF-IDF addresses term relevance, it remains unable to handle polysemous words accurately due to its single-representation approach.\n\n*   TF-IDF refines BoW by considering how important a word is in a document relative to the entire corpus.

For example, the word “bank” will have a single vector that averages contexts from both financial institutions and river banks.\n    *   **Limitations:**\n        *   This single-vector approach fails to capture distinct meanings accurately, leading to less precise embeddings for polysemous words.\n\n*   Word2Vec includes two model architectures: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram.

    "contentMarkdown": "#### Count-Based Techniques (TF-IDF and BM25)\n\n##### Pros\n\n1.  **Simplicity and Efficiency**: Easy to implement and computationally efficient, suitable for basic information retrieval tasks.\n2.  **Effectiveness in Document Retrieval**: Particularly good at identifying documents relevant to specific terms, thanks to their focus on term frequency.\n\n##### Cons\n\n1.  **Lack of Semantic Understanding**: They don’t capture deeper semantic relationships between words, leading to limited contextual interpretation.\n2.  **Sparse Representations**: Can result in high-dimensional and sparse vectors, which are less efficient for complex NLP tasks.\n\n#### Co-occurrence Based/Static Embedding Techniques (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)\n\n##### Pros\n\n1.  **Semantic Relationship Modeling**: Capable of capturing complex semantic relationships between words, offering richer representations.\n2.  **Subword Information (fastText)**: fastText’s consideration of subword elements aids in understanding morphology and handling out-of-vocabulary words.\n\n##### Cons\n\n1.  **Fixed Context**: Static embeddings assign a single, context-independent representation to each word, limiting their effectiveness in contextually varied scenarios.\n2.  **Computational Intensity**: Requires significant computational resources for training on large corpora.\n\n#### Contextualized Representation Techniques (BERT, ELMo)\n\n##### Pros\n\n1.  **Context-Sensitive**: They provide dynamic word representations based on context, leading to a more nuanced understanding of language.\n2.  **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Excel in a wide range of NLP tasks, offering superior performance compared to previous models.\n\n##### Cons\n\n1.  **Computational Requirements**: Demand extensive computational power and larger datasets for training.\n2.  **Complexity in Implementation**: More complex to implement and integrate into applications compared to simpler models like TF-IDF.\n\n**Method**\n\n**Type**\n\n**Captures Semantics?**\n\n**Dimensionality**\n\n**Contextual?**\n\n**Computational

This is in contrast to traditional bag-of-words models, which represent words using discrete and sparse vectors.\n\n#### Traditional Bag of Words\n\n*   **Discrete Representation:**\n    *   In a traditional Bag of Words model, each word is represented as a unique index in a vocabulary, creating a sparse and high-dimensional vector. For example, in a vocabulary of 10,000 words, “cat” might be represented as a vector with a 1 in the position corresponding to “cat” and 0s elsewhere.\n*   **Sparse Vectors:**\n    *   These vectors are sparse because most elements are zero. Each word vector is orthogonal to every other word vector, meaning there is no inherent similarity between words represented in this way.\n*   **No Context:**\n    *   BoW models do not capture the context in which words appear. They only consider word frequencies within documents, ignoring word order and contextual relationships.\n\n*   In a traditional Bag of Words model, each word is represented as a unique index in a vocabulary, creating a sparse and high-dimensional vector.

They only consider word frequencies within documents, ignoring word order and contextual relationships.\n\n#### Continuous Bag of Words\n\n*   **Continuous and Distributed Representation:**\n    *   The “continuous” in CBOW refers to the use of continuous and dense vectors to represent words. Instead of sparse vectors, each word is mapped to a dense vector of real numbers. These vectors are typically of much lower dimensionality (e.g., 100 or 300 dimensions) and are learned through training on a large corpus.\n*   **Contextual Embeddings:**\n    *   CBOW captures the context of a word by considering its surrounding words. Given a context (the words surrounding a target word), CBOW predicts the target word. For example, in the sentence “The cat sat on the mat,” the context for “sat” might be `[\"The\", \"cat\", \"on\", \"the\", \"mat\"]`.\n*   **Training Process:**\n    *   The model learns to maximize the probability of the target word given its context. This is done using a neural network that adjusts the word vectors to make similar words (words that appear in similar contexts) have similar vector representations.\n*   **Dense Vectors:**\n    *   Each word is associated with a dense vector that captures various syntactic and semantic properties. These vectors are “continuous” in that they can take on any value in the real-number space, unlike the discrete indices used in traditional BoW models.\n*   **Example:**\n    *   Suppose “cat” is represented by a 100-dimensional vector like `[0.25, -0.1, 0.75, ...]`. This vector is learned from the contexts in which “cat” appears, and words that appear in similar contexts (like “dog”) will have similar vectors.\n\n*   The “continuous” in CBOW refers to the use of continuous and dense vectors to represent words. Instead of sparse vectors, each word is mapped to a dense vector of real numbers.

This vector is learned from the contexts in which “cat” appears, and words that appear in similar contexts (like “dog”) will have similar vectors.\n\n#### Continuous Skipgram\n\n*   **Continuous and Distributed Representation:**\n    *   Similar to CBOW, the “continuous” in the Continuous Skipgram model refers to the continuous and dense word vectors used to represent words. These vectors are also of lower dimensionality and are learned from large corpora.\n*   **Reverse Prediction:**\n    *   Unlike CBOW, which predicts the target word from its context, Skipgram does the reverse: it predicts the context words given a target word. For example, in the sentence “The cat sat on the mat,” Skipgram would take “sat” as the input and try to predict words like “cat,” “on,” “the,” and “mat.”\n*   **Training Process:**\n    *   The Skipgram model learns to predict the surrounding words of a given target word by adjusting the word vectors during training. The objective is to maximize the probability of context words given the target word, ensuring that words appearing in similar contexts end up with similar vector representations.\n*   **Dense Vectors:**\n    *   Like CBOW, Skipgram also uses dense vectors to represent words. These vectors are continuous and can capture intricate relationships between words based on their context in a corpus.\n*   **Example:**\n    *   If “sat” is represented by a 100-dimensional vector `[0.12, -0.3, 0.58, ...]`, the Skipgram model would adjust this vector during training to maximize the likelihood of predicting context words like “cat” and “on” when “sat” is the input.\n\n*   Similar to CBOW, the “continuous” in the Continuous Skipgram model refers to the continuous and dense word vectors used to represent words. These vectors are also of lower dimensionality and are learned from large corpora.\n\n*   Unlike CBOW, which predicts the target word from its context, Skipgram does the reverse: it predicts the context words given a target word. For example, in the sentence “The cat sat on the mat,” Skipgram would take “sat” as the input and try to predict words like “cat,” “on,” “the,” and “mat.”\n\n*   The Skipgram model learns to predict the surrounding words of a given target word by adjusting the word vectors during training.

CBOW does this by predicting the target word from its context, while Skipgram predicts the context from the target word.\n2.  **Dense and Low-Dimensional Vectors:**\n    *   The use of dense, continuous vectors reduces the dimensionality of the word representation, making it computationally more efficient and enabling the model to generalize better.\n3.  **Semantic Similarity:**\n    *   Words with similar meanings or that appear in similar contexts will have similar embeddings, allowing for better semantic understanding.\n4.  **Efficient Training:**\n    *   CBOW is generally faster to train than Skipgram because it uses the entire context to predict the target word, while Skipgram can better capture rare word associations by focusing on predicting the context from the target word.\n\n*   Both models capture contextual relationships between words, leading to more meaningful word representations. CBOW does this by predicting the target word from its context, while Skipgram predicts the context from the target word.\n\n*   The use of dense, continuous vectors reduces the dimensionality of the word representation, making it computationally more efficient and enabling the model to generalize better.\n\n*   Words with similar meanings or that appear in similar contexts will have similar embeddings, allowing for better semantic understanding.\n\n*   CBOW is generally faster to train than Skipgram because it uses the entire context to predict the target word, while Skipgram can better capture rare word associations by focusing on predicting the context from the target word.\n\n#### Summary\n\n*   The “continuous” in both CBOW and Skipgram highlights the transition from discrete, sparse word representations to continuous, dense vector representations. This shift allows these models to capture contextual information and semantic relationships between words more effectively, leading to more powerful and meaningful word embeddings. CBOW excels in efficiency, while Skipgram often provides richer representations for rare words due to its reverse prediction approach.",

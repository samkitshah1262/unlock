Each task is associated with specific acceptance criteria or expected outcomes that need to be met for the task to be considered complete.</li>\n      <li><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> This ensures clarity on what “done” looks like for each task. By tracking tasks in sprint planning meetings, the team can better understand workload, dependencies, and timelines. It helps maintain focus on short-term deliverables, ensuring that each sprint (typically 1-4 weeks) delivers incremental value to the product.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Conduct sprint review meetings to evaluate sprint outcomes and gather feedback.</strong></p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>What this means:</strong> Sprint review meetings are held at the end of each sprint to evaluate the work completed, showcase it to stakeholders, and gather feedback. These meetings provide an opportunity for the team to demonstrate what they have accomplished and discuss what could be improved moving forward.</li>\n      <li><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> Sprint reviews foster transparency and collaboration with stakeholders, ensuring that the work delivered meets expectations and aligns with business needs. The feedback collected helps refine future plans, address any issues, and maintain momentum toward achieving overall project goals.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Track sprints aligned with a project milestone in project/milestone review meetings.</strong></p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>What this means:</strong> Sprints are tracked and reviewed in the context of larger project milestones. After each sprint, progress is evaluated against these milestones during project or milestone review meetings.</li>\n      <li><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> This method helps maintain alignment between short-term sprint goals and long-term project milestones. By regularly reviewing the sprint outcomes in the context of milestones, teams can ensure that the project is moving forward at the right pace and that potential issues are identified early. This enables more informed decision-making, such as adjusting priorities or timelines as needed.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Track project milestones as part of OKRs (which might encompass more than one project) to ensure strategic alignment.</strong></p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>What this means:</strong> Project milestones are tracked in the context of OKRs, which represent broader organizational goals. OKRs are high-level objectives, typically set quarterly, with measurable key results that demonstrate progress toward those objectives. Milestones across multiple projects can contribute to achieving these OKRs.</li>\n      <li><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> This creates a direct link between project work and the overall strategic direction of the organization. Tracking milestones against OKRs ensures that project outcomes align with the larger business goals.

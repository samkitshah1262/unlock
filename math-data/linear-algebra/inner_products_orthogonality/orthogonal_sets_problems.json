    "solutionHtml": " Let $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ be two vectors in the set. We want them to satisfy \\(\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2 = 0\\) and \\(\\lVert \\mathbf{v}_1 \\rVert = \\lVert \\mathbf{v}_2 \\rVert = 1\\). Suppose we have a third vector $\\mathbf{v}_3$. We can write it as a linear combination of the first two: \\(\\mathbf{v}_3 = a_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + a_2 \\mathbf{v}_2\\). Now, take the dot product with each of the first two vectors:\\begin{align*} 0 &= (\\mathbf{v}_3 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_1) = (a_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + a_2 \\mathbf{v}_2) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_1\\\\ 0 &= (\\mathbf{v}_3 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2) = (a_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + a_2 \\mathbf{v}_2) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2 \\end{align*}Simplifying, we get $a_1 (\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_1) = 0$ and $a_2 (\\mathbf{v}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2) = 0$. Since $\\lVert \\mathbf{v}_1 \\rVert = \\lVert \\mathbf{v}_2 \\rVert = 1$, we have $(\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_1) = (\\mathbf{v}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2) = 1$. Therefore, $a_1 = a_2 = 0$ and $\\mathbf{v}_3$ is orthogonal to both $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$. By induction, we can show that any set of vectors satisfying these properties will be orthogonal and orthonormal. \",",

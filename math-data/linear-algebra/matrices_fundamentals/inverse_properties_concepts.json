But what are the properties of these inverses?</p><p>For starters, let's consider the product of two matrices, one of which has an inverse. We can write this as \\(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}^{-1}\\). Now, if we multiply both sides by \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), we get \\(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{A}\\). Since the inverse of a matrix is defined as the matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, results in the identity matrix, we can substitute \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) for \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is the identity matrix. This gives us \\(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot (\\mathbf{I})^{-1} = \\mathbf{A}\\). Since the inverse of the identity matrix is itself, we can simplify this to just \\(\\mathbf{A}\\).</p>\",",

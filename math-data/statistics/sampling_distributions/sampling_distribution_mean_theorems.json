      "proofSketch": "The expected value of the sample mean is equal to the population mean (μ) due to the law of large numbers. The variance of the sample mean is the population variance (σ^2) divided by the sample size (n), which can be proven using the delta method."

    "intuition": "In simple terms, the sampling distribution of the mean shows how the average value of a random sample from a population varies around the true population mean. This concept is crucial in statistical inference as it allows us to make inferences about the population based on a single sample.",

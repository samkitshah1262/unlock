That's where nonparametric tests come in – a set of powerful tools that don't rely on specific distributions.</p><p>In this card, we'll explore four essential nonparametric tests: Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and permutation tests. These methods are crucial for ML/AI practitioners, as they provide a way to analyze data without making strong assumptions about its underlying structure.</p>",

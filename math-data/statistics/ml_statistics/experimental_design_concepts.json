    "contentHtml": "<p>In experimental design, we aim to isolate the effect of a treatment or variable on an outcome by minimizing confounding variables. Two essential techniques for achieving this are randomization and blocking.</p><p>Randomization involves assigning units (e.g., participants, samples) to different groups (treatments or control) in a way that is unpredictable and unbiased. This helps ensure that any observed differences between groups are due to the treatment rather than other factors.</p>",

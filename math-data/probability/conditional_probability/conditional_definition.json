    "solutionHtml": "Let's break this down step-by-step. First, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes: \\(\\frac{6!}{3!\\cdot 3!} = 20\\). Then, we count the number of even outcomes given that at least one of the first three rolls was even: \\(\\frac{4!}{2!\\cdot 2!}\\) (even outcomes with at least one even roll in the first three) plus \\(\\frac{2!}{1!}\\) (all odd outcomes). This gives us \\(8 + 6 = 14\\) favorable outcomes. Finally, we divide by the total number of possible outcomes: \\(\\frac{14}{20} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{10}}\\).\",",

We know that P(T|D) = 0.95.  Using Bayes' Theorem, we get:  P(D|T) = \\(\\frac{P(T|D) \\cdot P(D)}{P(T)}\\)  We can simplify this to:  P(D|T) = \\(\\frac{0.95 \\cdot P(D)}{\\int_{0}^{1} 0.95 \\cdot x dx}\\)  Since we don't know the exact value of P(D), we'll assume it's uniform, i.e., P(D) = 0.01.  Plugging this in, we get:  P(D|T) = \\(\\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.01}{\\int_{0}^{1} 0.95 \\cdot x dx}\\) ≈ 0.322  So the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is approximately 32.2%. \",",

    "solutionHtml": " Let's start by considering a small interval [x, x + dx] within the support of X. The probability that X falls within this interval is f(x) \\* dx.  The CDF F(x) represents the cumulative probability up to x, so we need to find P(X ≤ x). This can be written as:  F(x) = ∫[0,x] f(t) dt  Now, we can use the definition of the PDF to rewrite this integral:  F(x) = ∫[0,x] f(t) dt = ∫[0,x] \\frac{1}{b-a} \\* 1 dx  where [a, b] is the support of X. Evaluating this integral, we get:  F(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a}x  The final answer is: F(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a}x \",",

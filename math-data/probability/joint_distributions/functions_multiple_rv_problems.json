This is because the sum of two independent RVs can be viewed as the combination of two separate events, where one event occurs when X takes on a particular value and the other event occurs when Y takes on a particular value. The probability of this combined event is then given by the product of the probabilities of each individual event.  For example, if we have two independent RVs X and Y with PDFs P(X) = 1/2 \\(\\delta(x-1)\\) + 1/2 \\(\\delta(x+1)\\) and P(Y) = 1/3 \\(\\delta(y-1)\\) + 2/3 \\(\\delta(y+1)\\), then the distribution of Z = X + Y is given by:  P(Z = z) = \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (1/2) \\delta(x-1) (1/3) \\delta(z-x-1) dx\\) + \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (1/2) \\delta(x+1) (2/3) \\delta(z-x+1) dx\\)  Evaluating this integral, we get:  P(Z = z) = 1/6 \\(\\delta(z-0)\\) + 1/3 \\(\\delta(z-2)\\) + 1/3 \\(\\delta(z+2)\\) \",",
